Filion, an 18-year-old from Lancaster, Calif., was sentenced to four years in prison for making nearly 400 false bomb threats and threats of violence (source may be paywalled; alternative source) to religious institutions, schools, universities and homes across the country. The New York Times reports: The threatening calls Mr. Filion made would often cause large deployments of police officers to a targeted location, the Justice Department said in a news release. In some cases, officers would enter people's homes with their weapons drawn and detain those inside. In January 2023, Mr. Filion wrote on social media that his swats had often led the police to "drag the victim and their families out of the house cuff them and search the house for dead bodies."
 
Investigators linked Mr. Filion to over 375 swatting calls made in several states, including one that he made to the police in Sanford, Fla., saying that he would commit a mass shooting at the Masjid Al Hayy Mosque. During the call, he played audio of gunfire in the background. Mr. Filion was arrested in California in January 2024, and was then extradited to Florida to face state charges for making that threat. Mr. Filion began swatting for recreation in August 2022 before making it into a business, the Justice Department said. The teenager became a "serial swatter" and would make social media posts about his "swatting-for-a-fee" services, according to prosecutors.
 
In addition to pleading guilty to the false threat against the mosque in Florida, Mr. Filion pleaded guilty in three other swatting cases: a mass shooting threat to a public school in Washington State in October 2022; a bomb threat call to a historically Black college or university in Florida in May 2023; and a July 2023 call in which he claimed to be a federal law enforcement officer in Texas and told dispatchers that he had killed his mother and would kill any responding officers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>KDE Plasma 6.3 Released</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/11/2229240/kde-plasma-63-released?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, the KDE Project announced the release of KDE Plasma 6.3, featuring improved fractional scaling, enhanced Night Light color accuracy, better CPU usage monitoring, and various UI and security refinements.

Now, the Automattic-owned blogging platform is sharing more information about when and how that integration could actually happen. As it turns out, the current plan to tie Tumblr into the open social web will come about by way of the site's planned move to the WordPress infrastructure. Automattic confirmed to TechCrunch that when the migration is complete, every Tumblr user will be able to federate their blog via ActivityPub, just as every WordPress.com user can today. The company noted that the migration could also allow for other open web integrations, like giving Tumblr users a way to run other custom plug-ins or themes.
 
Last summer, Automattic announced it would move its half a billion blogs to WordPress, to make it easier for the company to build tools and features that worked across both services, while also allowing Tumblr to take advantage of the open source developments from WordPress.org. Though the WordPress community itself is in a state of upheaval, ultimately running Tumblr's back end on WordPress would allow for greater efficiencies, while not changing the interface and experience that Tumblr's user base has grown to love. Automattic declined to share a time frame as to when the migration would be complete, given its scale, but a rep for the company called the progress so far "exciting." Automattic didn't say if it would consider integrating with the AT Protocol that powers Bluesky.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Founders Fund is about to close another $3B fund</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/founders-fund-is-about-to-close-another-3b-fund/</link><author>Marina Temkin</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 23:31:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Founders Fund is on track to conclude fundraising of its third growth fund at the end of March, according to people close to the firm.

Tom's Hardware reports: We see the biggest drop in laptop CPU performance results. PassMark recorded an average result of 14,632 across 101,316 samples last year. But, in 2025, the average score sat at an average of 14,130 points between 25,541 samples, decreasing the average score by 3.4%. The average desktop PC result in 2024 netted 26,436 points for 186,053 samples. But for 2025, the average score currently sits at 26,311 points for over 47,810 samples -- a 0.5% drop from last year. While that drop is small, we should only see a continued progression of faster performance.
 
[...] Passmark itself mused on X (formerly Twitter) that it could be that people are switching to more affordable machines that deliver lower power and performance. Or maybe Windows 11 is depressing performance scores versus Windows 10, especially as people transition to it with the upcoming demise of the latter. We've certainly seen plenty of examples of reduced performance in gaming with some of the newer versions of Windows 11, particularly as Intel and AMD struggled to upstream needed updates into the OS.

Currently, it’s available only to Pro users in the U.S., but it’s coming globally soon. 🌍\
Cool, right? But hold up—are we sure websites won’t push back? 🤔 Will current anti-bot tech like IP bans, browser fingerprints, TLS fingerprints, and, of course, CAPTCHAs keep up with OpenAI’s new tool?\
So, who’s really winning in this battle between complex automated bots and anti-bot defenses? Read on to find out! 🔥LLM Models and Online Data: A Rocky RelationshipWhen LLM models first hit the market, it was nothing short of a revolution. The way we approach everyday tasks at work changed forever, the stock market reacted with excitement 🚀, and everyone jumped on the AI train (even if there wasn’t  AI behind most online products yet).\
So, where does all that data come from? Easy answer:  🌍\
The Web is the biggest source of data on the planet, so it’s no surprise companies like OpenAI scraped the Internet for years to collect the data needed to train their groundbreaking tech. And as long as web scraping is done ethically, there's nothing wrong with that 🤷.\
But here’s the catch: Most site owners aren’t thrilled about AI companies using their data! 😠\
In short, giving away your data for free is basically the same as handing out cash 💸. No wonder site owners—especially big companies—aren’t exactly thrilled about that. 😅\
Now that the landscape is evolving and new AI operators and tools are entering the scene, websites may start to get  unhappy about it. 😬AI Operators vs Websites: The Next Phase of This Troubled Relationship“Operator is powered by a new model called Computer-Using Agent (CUA). Combining GPT-4’s vision capabilities with advanced reasoning through reinforcement learning, CUA is trained to interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs)—the buttons, menus, and text fields people see on a screen.”\
It’s clear that, while AI companies like OpenAI have previously built scraping bots to gather data from popular sources to train their models, they’re now giving users a tool that can “magically” interact with and navigate websites. That’s both exciting and scary! 😱\
See OpenAI's Operator in action in the presentation video:\
Again, from the official presentation article:“Operator can “see” (through screenshots) and “interact” (using all the actions a mouse and keyboard allow) with a browser, enabling it to take action on the web without requiring custom API integrations.\
  If it encounters challenges or makes mistakes, Operator can leverage its reasoning capabilities to self-correct. When it gets stuck and needs assistance, it simply hands control back to the user, ensuring a smooth and collaborative experience.”\
That’s incredibly promising, but it also raises some serious concerns. 🤔 What if users start abusing Operator for malicious purposes? We’ve all had enough of bots (like those spammy comments flooding YouTube), and this could quickly spiral into a major problem. ⚠️\
Assuming OpenAI manages to prevent Operator from performing harmful or unwanted actions—just like they've worked to keep ChatGPT from answering dangerous questions—can we really be sure that most websites will welcome this kind of new, automated, AI-powered interaction? 🤖Before diving into the big question we left open, let’s first clarify what kind of interactions we’re dealing with. At the end of the day, if these new AI operators aren’t as effective as we think, why should we even bother protecting against them in the first place? 👀\
Currently, only U.S. users paying $200 a month for the highest subscription tier of ChatGPT Pro can access OpenAI’s Operator, so not everyone has had the chance to test it out. But for those who have? The results are impressive! 🤯\
Early users and tech reviewers found OpenAI’s amazing at automating everyday tasks like:Ordering food (yes, it can even automatically make decisions like choosing what restaurants to order from 🍔)Replying to users on some social media platformsCompleting small online tasks such as filling out surveys for rewards\
How is that possible? Operator opens a mini browser window and completes tasks based on your text prompts—just like a regular user would:\
Sure, the product is still in the “research preview” stage and isn’t perfect. Occasionally, you’ll need to give it a nudge or rescue it from a loop of failed attempts.\
➡️ The real question now: Will websites welcome AI-powered automation, or will they fight back? And if they do, how? ⚔️How Websites Are Fighting Back Against AIAnti-bot and anti-scraping solutions are nothing new—many sites have been using them for years to protect against automated scripts scraping data and interacting with their pages. 🚫\
If you’re curious about these methods, check out our webinar on advanced anti-bot techniques:: Tools that restrict the number of requests from a user in a given time to prevent overload. They work by banning IPs.: A method that tracks the unique characteristics of a browser’s encrypted connection to identify bots. Explore the role of TLS fingerprinting in web scraping.: A technique for detecting unique device or browser attributes to spot automated tools.These initial defenses focus on blocking requests from automated tools (like AI operators) before they even get a chance to access the site 🛡️.\
If those defenses fail, other techniques come into play. Some examples? CAPTCHAs are particularly effective because they’re designed to be easy for humans to solve, but tough for bots to crack.\
But with AI getting smarter and starting to think more like humans, recognizing bots is becoming harder. This is why some wild ideas, like using video games as CAPTCHAs, are being tossed around. 🎮\
But the real question is—are CAPTCHAs the ultimate solution against AI operators? Let’s dive in and find out! 💡Solving CAPTCHAs: Can AI Operators Really Beat the System?: Nope, not really… 🙅‍♂️\
Since OpenAI Operator hit the market for testing, users have been pushing it to complete tasks that involve CAPTCHAs—logging into social media, filling out forms, and more.“While it handles most steps automatically, CUA seeks user confirmation for sensitive actions, such as entering login details or responding to CAPTCHA forms.”\
Sure, sometimes the AI’s reasoning engine might sneak past a CAPTCHA 🥷, but more often than not, —with results that are both hilarious and frustrating. When put to the test on Reddit, Google Maps, Amazon, and G2, it repeatedly gets shut down by anti-bot protections.Watching AI operators crash and burn against CAPTCHAs has become a viral trend. Videos of these AI tools fumbling their way through login attempts are flooding Reddit and X:\
On one hand, this is reassuring—CAPTCHAs are doing their job and stopping automated bots from wreaking havoc. On the other hand, we’re in a cat-and-mouse game 🐁 🐈. Anti-bot tech and AI operators will keep evolving, taking turns being one step ahead.\
The real losers? Regular users! More sites will likely implement CAPTCHAs, making browsing more painful for everyone. And let’s be honest—we all hate CAPTCHAs. 😩\
This battle doesn’t just affect AI operators—ethical web scrapers are also getting caught in the crossfire. As sites ramp up anti-bot measures, legitimate scraping scripts will be unfairly blocked, making data extraction harder for researchers, businesses, and developers.\
Luckily, there’s a better way to interact with sites programmatically  dealing with CAPTCHAs and other anti-bot nightmares: Scraping Browser!The Real Winner? Bright Data’s Scraping Browser!OpenAI Operator automates regular browsers just like other browser automation tools. But here’s the thing—most anti-bot technologies, including CAPTCHAs, don’t appear  of the automation itself. They show up due to how the browser is configured!\
Most browser automation libraries set up browsers in ways that expose them as automated, completely defeating the purpose of using a “regular” browser. That’s where anti-bot systems step in and block access. 🚫\
Instead of focusing on whether AI can bypass CAPTCHAs, the real game-changer is using the right browser—one optimized for scraping and automation. That’s exactly where Bright Data’s Scraping Browser comes in, packed with:Reliable TLS fingerprints to avoid detection for large-scale data extraction powered by a 72-million IP proxy network to handle failed requestsCAPTCHA-solving superpowers that outperform AI operators 🧠\
Bright Data’s CAPTCHA solver has proven successful against:reCAPTCHA ✔️ (yep, the one OpenAI Operator couldn’t solve in the tweet above)\
Not only does it reduce the chances of CAPTCHAs appearing, but when they do show up, it . 🔥\
Scraping Browser works with all major browser automation frameworks—including Playwright, Puppeteer, and Selenium. So whether you want full programmatic control or even to add AI logic on top, you’re covered.\
See Bright Data’s Scraping Browser in action:\
So… should we keep forcing AI to solve CAPTCHAs, or just use a tool that works? The choice is obvious.  🏆OpenAI’s Operator is here to revolutionize web interaction—but it’s not all-powerful. While impressive, it still struggles against CAPTCHAs and gets blocked.\
Avoid the hassle with Scraping Browser, featuring a built-in CAPTCHA Solver for seamless automation. Embark on our quest to democratize the Web, ensuring it remains accessible for all, everywhere, even through automated scripts!\
Until next time, keep exploring the Internet freely and without CAPTCHAs!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AUKUS Blasts Holes In LockBit&apos;s Bulletproof Hosting Provider</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/02/11/2156211/aukus-blasts-holes-in-lockbits-bulletproof-hosting-provider?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 22:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The US, UK, and Australia (AUKUS) have sanctioned Russian bulletproof hosting provider Zservers, accusing it of supporting LockBit ransomware operations by providing secure infrastructure for cybercriminals. The sanctions target Zservers, its UK front company XHOST Internet Solutions, and six individuals linked to its operations. The Register reports: Headquartered in Barnaul, Russia, Zservers provided BPH services to a number of LockBit affiliates, the three nations said today. On numerous occasions, affiliates purchased servers from the company to support ransomware attacks. The trio said the link between Zservers and LockBit was established as early as 2022, when Canadian law enforcement searched a known LockBit affiliate and found evidence they had purchased infrastructure tooling almost certainly used to host chatrooms with ransomware victims.
 
"Ransomware actors and other cybercriminals rely on third-party network service providers like Zservers to enable their attacks on US and international critical infrastructure," said Bradley T Smith, acting under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence. "Today's trilateral action with Australia and the United Kingdom underscores our collective resolve to disrupt all aspects of this criminal ecosystem, wherever located, to protect our national security." The UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) said additionally that the UK front company for Zservers, XHOST Internet Solutions, was also included in its sanctions list. According to Companies House, the UK arm was incorporated on January 31, 2022, although the original service was established in 2011 and operated in both Russia and the Netherlands. Anyone found to have business dealings with either entity can face criminal and civil charges under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018.
 
The UK led the way with sanctions, placing six individuals and the two entities on its list, while the US only placed two of the individuals -- both alleged Zservers admins -- on its equivalent. Alexander Igorevich Mishin and Aleksandr Sergeyevich Bolshakov, both 30 years old, were named by the US as the operation's heads. Mishin was said to have marketed Zservers to LockBit and other ransomware groups, managing the associated cryptocurrency transactions. Both he and Bolshakov responded to a complaint from a Lebanese company in 2023 and shut down an IP address used in a LockBit attack. The US said, however, it was possible that the pair set up a replacement IP address that LockBit could carry on using, while telling the Lebanese company that they complied with its request. The UK further sanctioned Ilya Vladimirovich Sidorov, Dmitry Konstantinovich Bolshakov (no mention of whether he is any relation to Aleksandr), Igor Vladimirovich Odintsov, and Vladimir Vladimirovich Ananev. Other than that they were Zservers employees and thus were directly or indirectly involved in attempting to inflict economic loss to the country, not much was said about either of their roles.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New hack uses prompt injection to corrupt Gemini’s long-term memory</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/new-hack-uses-prompt-injection-to-corrupt-geminis-long-term-memory/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gemini_header-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 22:13:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the nascent field of AI hacking, indirect prompt injection has become a basic building block for inducing chatbots to exfiltrate sensitive data or perform other malicious actions. Developers of platforms such as Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT are generally good at plugging these security holes, but hackers keep finding new ways to poke through them again and again.On Monday, researcher Johann Rehberger demonstrated a new way to override prompt injection defenses Google developers have built into Gemini—specifically, defenses that restrict the invocation of Google Workspace or other sensitive tools when processing untrusted data, such as incoming emails or shared documents. The result of Rehberger’s attack is the permanent planting of long-term memories that will be present in all future sessions, opening the potential for the chatbot to act on false information or instructions in perpetuity.More about the attack later. For now, here is a brief review of indirect prompt injections: Prompts in the context of large language models (LLMs) are instructions, provided either by the chatbot developers or by the person using the chatbot, to perform tasks, such as summarizing an email or drafting a reply. But what if this content contains a malicious instruction? It turns out that chatbots are so eager to follow instructions that they often take their orders from such content, even though there was never an intention for it to act as a prompt.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple Maps plans to show ‘Gulf of America,’ following Google</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/apple-maps-plans-to-show-gulf-of-america-following-google/</link><author>Maxwell Zeff</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 22:09:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple Maps will soon rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, following similar changes made by Google this week, in order to comply with U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive order that officially changed the name.

In 2020, the media and technology conglomerate filed an unprecedentedAI copyright lawsuit against the legal AI startup Ross Intelligence. In the complaint, Thomson Reuters claimed the AI firm reproduced materials from its legal research firm Westlaw. Today, a judge ruled (PDF) in Thomson Reuters' favor, finding that the company's copyright was indeed infringed by Ross Intelligence's actions. "None of Ross's possible defenses holds water. I reject them all," wrote US District Court of Delaware judge Stephanos Bibas, in a summary judgement. [...] Notably, Judge Bibas ruled in Thomson Reuters' favor on the question of fair use.
 
The fair use doctrine is a key component of how AI companies are seeking to defend themselves against claims that they used copyrighted materials illegally. The idea underpinning fair use is that sometimes it's legally permissible to use copyrighted works without permission -- for example, to create parody works, or in noncommercial research or news production. When determining whether fair use applies, courts use a four-factor test, looking at the reason behind the work, the nature of the work (whether it's poetry, nonfiction, private letters, et cetera), the amount of copyrighted work used, and how the use impacts the market value of the original. Thomson Reuters prevailed on two of the four factors, but Bibas described the fourth as the most important, and ruled that Ross "meant to compete with Westlaw by developing a market substitute." "If this decision is followed elsewhere, it's really bad for the generative AI companies," says James Grimmelmann, Cornell University professor of digital and internet law.

The deal, which requires Army approval, could be worth over $20 billion in the next decade if all options are exercised, according to Bloomberg. The IVAS system, based on Microsoft's HoloLens mixed reality platform, aims to equip soldiers with advanced capabilities including night vision and airborne threat detection. 

Under the new arrangement, Microsoft will transition to providing cloud computing and AI infrastructure, while Anduril assumes control of hardware production and software development. The Army has planned orders for up to 121,000 units, though full production hinges on passing combat testing this year. 

The program has faced technical hurdles, with early prototypes causing headaches and nausea among soldiers. The current slimmer version has received better feedback, though cost remains a concern - the Army indicated the $80,000 per-unit price needs to "be substantially less" to justify large-scale procurement. 

Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, writing in a blog post: This move has been so many years in the making, over a decade of hacking and scheming and dreaming and building with exactly this specific outcome clearly visualized in my mind's eye. I can hardly believe I managed to pull it off. Everything I've done in my career -- building Oculus out of a camper trailer, shipping VR to millions of consumers, getting run out of Silicon Valley by backstabbing snakes, betting that Anduril could tear people out of the bigtech megacorp matrix and put them to work on our nation's most important problems -- has led to this moment. IVAS isn't just another product, it is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine how technology supports those who serve. We have a shot to prove that this long-standing dream is no windmill, that this can expand far beyond one company or one headset and act as a a nexus for the best of the best to set a new standard for how a large collection of companies can work together to solve our nation's most important problems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neverending Options: Trading Options To Infinity And Beyond</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/neverending-options-trading-options-to-infinity-and-beyond?source=rss</link><author>2077 Research</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 20:30:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Explore the evolution of crypto options and perpetual futures, including innovations like panoptions, and the challenges of liquidity and decentralization.\
Crypto was born to disrupt the financial world, and it has, albeit not in the way Satoshi Nakamoto intended. In becoming so much more, it grew into a massive playground for speculation. Traders weren’t satisfied with spot trading and turned their eyes to derivatives like futures and options.\
In this article, we break down options—how they differ from futures and the evolution of perpetual options on centralised and decentralised exchanges. We also examine flaws and challenges and speculate on what the future holds. Sit tight, and let’s dive in!A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy/sell a certain asset (the underlying) at a given time in the future. At first, futures were invented to hedge risks associated with commodities like soy, crude oil, or gold. A seller can set a price before they can deliver the underlying and let the buyer assume some of the risks. Since you don't get the underlying when you sign the contract, you don't have to pay the full price. Instead, a deposit equal to a portion of your position's value is all you need to keep this contract valid. Therefore, you can sign a futures contract worth $100 with only $10 and if the price goes up by 10% to $110, you will get a 100% profit ($10). Such is the power of leverage and is ideal for crypto investors seeking to amplify their returns.\
Eventually, someone realized you don't have to deliver the product at a given time because cryptocurrencies will always be there. A futures contract that never expires looks tempting to anyone seeking 100X their investments.\
There is one caveat, though. Since Satoshi Nakamoto released his famous whitepaper, the overwhelming majority of the crypto community has been longing cryptocurrencies. As a consequence, the futures market will be dominated by buyers, moving the futures price ridiculously higher than its spot price.\
Traditional futures contracts also have this problem but the market has a way to manage it. These contracts expire, so any deviation between the futures price and the spot price gradually disappears as the expiry date approaches.It happens because the difference between buying on the futures market and the spot market becomes smaller over time.\
The same can not be said for perpetual futures. Now that they don't expire, we may never see the day when the basis disappears. Something must be done.\
For the record, we don't know what happened when BitMEX invented perpetual futures but since these contracts are sometimes referred to as perpetual swaps, one can only assume that they decided to borrow a mechanism from swap contracts - an agreement between two parties to exchange cash flow, typically used to hedge the risk of oscillating loan interest rates or to exchange value between two positions.\
With this mechanism, perpetual futures buyers and sellers must exchange cash flow (making 'funding payments') with each other based on the difference between the underlying's futures price and spot price. If the futures price is higher (the underlying trading at a premium), the buyers have outbought the sellers. At such times, the funding rate mechanism dictates buyers must pay sellers based on their position size. This way, sellers will have enough reason to hold on to their short positions and buyers will have their accounts bled dry if they keep their long positions open indefinitely.The reason we spent hundreds of words talking about perpetual futures in an article dedicated to options is that we wish to demonstrate how removing a seemingly insignificant variable (expiry date) from a financial instrument could lead to starking imbalances in the market and take some of the most innovative minds to fix it by introducing a new mechanism.Options are quite like futures, except futures contracts impose on both parties the obligation to transact a certain asset at a given time, whereas options only give them the right. You have the option to pocket your profit when your option is in the money (ITM), as well as throw it into the bin when it's out of the money (OTM).\
As such, futures contracts can be priced based on their entry price but options must charge a premium for signing this contract. This premium is the price a buyer pays a seller (writer) and options at each price tick form a market on their own. Buyers are free to choose the lowest ask they can find for a certain underlying at a certain strike price. Once again, removing one restraint (obligation to buy or sell) from a financial instrument leads to an entirely different derivative.\
Traditional options already give investors immense flexibility for locking profits and hedging risks. You can hold a long position for an underlying while buying a put option of the same size for the same underlying at the same price. This way, if the price goes down, your long position is at a loss but the amount is only equal to your profit from the put option (or its seller), leaving you losing only the premium you paid for your put. If the price goes up, your long position stands to profit and you can throw your OTM put option in the bin.\
As you have seen, even options that expire are already much more complex than futures. Black, Scholes, and Merton won a Nobel Prize for developing a formula for stock options valuation. But what if we take it a step further and remove the expiry date from the options, like what we did to futures?There are two approaches that have our attention. One was proposed by Paradigm and the notorious Sam Bankman-Fried in their research titled 'Everlasting Options', and the other by Panoptic.Everlasting options: A universal funding model for efficient liquidity and arbitrageIn this paper, the authors proposed a universal funding mechanism for derivatives based on the difference between mark price and index price of the underlying (for futures) or the contract itself (for options). This is a generalised version of the perpetual futures funding mechanism and backed by the no-arbitrage pricing model that where there is a potential profit, there will be arbitrageurs to make the most of it. In the case of perpetual futures, buyers will pay sellers when the mark price is higher than the spot price or in the case of everlasting options, when the mark price is higher than the potential payoff.\
This universal mechanism is playing the arbitrageuers and such activities are ideal for centralized exchanges since the calculations and payments can be made within milliseconds by their complex trading engine running on mega servers. Indeed, the authors mentioned the traditional crypto options market being a nightmare (in our own words) for market makers because there are just so many markets to make. Their everlasting options are equivalent to a basket of options with different expiration times and weights equal to the inverse of 2 to the power of the number of funding cycles before the expiration time. This way, market makers can concentrate their liquidity on these baskets instead of spreading it on 100 markets.\
But the thing is, no one said options can only be traded on centralized exchanges with large institutions as market makers/liquidity providers. A decentralised ecosystem calls for decentralised protocols, and mechanisms that are less costly and cumbersome for smart contracts.Panoptions: A Uniswap-inspired, oracle-free revolutionEnter Panoptic with their perpetual options ('Panoptions'). By comparing a put option to a Uniswap V3 liquidity pool, they proposed this on-chain option that never expires.\
Uniswap V3 pools allow liquidity providers to deposit 2 assets and earn fees when the price ratio between these 2 assets is within a certain range. When it's out of the range, your liquidity becomes 100% of the asset with the lower price. Panoptic put options are essentially concentrated liquidity deployed on a single price point - its strike price. Let's pretend you hold an ETH-USDT Panoptic put option. When ETH's price goes above the strike price, this put option is OTM and becomes 100% USDT. When ETH's price is below the strike price, the buyer can give 1 ETH to the seller in exchange for all the USDT in the pool, earning the difference between the strike price and the price they paid for that 1 ETH.\
Panoptic call options work exactly the same except the 2 assets must switch places.\
But that's only half the formula. We still need to price the Panoptions by putting a premium on them. In contrast to traditional options, Panoptions charge no premium upfront and assume that the value of options can be realised over time.\
Meet θ, a Greek letter used to define the rate of an option's value decline over time. If you studied derivatives (the mathematical one), you would know the derivative of mileage over time is velocity - the rate/speed of your mileage increase over time. And by integrating the speed over time, you get mileage. Theoretically, the same goes for options: if we integrate θ, the 'value speed', over time, we get value.We are able to do this because there is another formula for θ instead of doing derivatives:\
Where S denotes the underlying asset spot (or current) price, σ is the asset’s volatility, K is the strike price, and t is the time to expiration.\
Note this formula is flawed since we assumed a 0 risk-free interest rate when in reality it can get quite higher. But how high? Should we take the interest rate from Binance Earn, ETH staking, Aave Lend, or heaven forbid, treasury bonds? This question may take an industry to answer.\
The good news is, we still haven't said a word about oracles because by tethering Panoptions to the corresponding Uniswap V3 pool, this system won't ever need an oracle as long as there are enough traders swapping tokens via this pool.\
This way, we have a simulated option on smart contracts, a premium that is price path dependent but oracle-free, and some solid knowledge in derivatives, both financial and mathematical. We are probably more ready than 99.9% of individuals on earth to trade options.Perpetual options on-chainPanoptic built an entire options trading ecosystem with smart contracts. Participants are divided into liquidity providers, option sellers, and option buyers.\
Before anyone can do anything, liquidity providers must first deposit assets into a liquidity pool. Sellers and buyers must also deposit their collateral. Sellers need to first mint their call or put option by paying a 0.1% commission and locking up (borrowing) a certain amount of liquidity at a strike price. Then, buyers can buy these options by paying the same rate of commission, locking up some more liquidity, and minting their position.\
Since our premium is accumulated over time, there should be 0 premium when the option was just sold. Instead, sellers would be credited a streaming premium every time the spot price crosses the strike price.\
When exercising their options, buyers will pay back their borrowed liquidity plus premium while getting the numeraire (for put options) or the underlying asset (for call options).\
On one hand, Panoptions is genius. By synthesising options with Uniswap V3 pools and settling premium when the option is exercised, the entire process is moved onto the blockchain. Anyone can access these financial instruments as long as they know their way around wallets and smart contracts. Under the ERC-1155 token standard, you can mint several options into one token for further risk and volatility customisation or even duplicate a composition someone else just shared.\
On the other hand, since Panoptions can be minted at 0 premium and a 0.1% fee, who's to stop arbitrageurs from buying ITM options before immediately exercising them for guaranteed profit? After a few costly lessons, who's to encourage sellers into minting ITM positions only to lose money? With only OTM options, the market will be as bustling as an empty bucket.Finding the f(law) in funding & financeThat's not to say the centralised approach has no flaw. The universal funding mechanism can be perfect if the funding is calculated and implemented every nanosecond. But when the funding cycle is stretched to 8 hours, a lot of things can happen right before and after funding payments are made. People may open a position 0.01 seconds before funding and close it immediately after receiving funding payments, leading to abnormal fluctuations around the time of funding.\
If we take a step back, the funding mechanism is merely a bandaid slapped onto someone with a headache that is CEX-traded crypto options. The real hurdle that is holding so many exchanges back from introducing options is the lack of liquidity.\
When you first look at it, crypto options seem a good instrument boasting similar open interest to perpetual futures:\
When in reality, the options market is divided into hundreds of sub-markets, each with a different expiration, strike price, and supply & demand. As a result, liquidity is fragmented into dozens of pieces and the spread on some sub-markets can be jaw-dropping. And that's just Bitcoin. Go to Bybit, the 2nd/3rd CEX, and look for options for Solana, the 4th largest crypto (not counting stablecoins) looking to surpass Ether, you'll find almost half of the sub-markets empty. Options are just too complex for investors without a systematic understanding of finance and investing, at least at first glance. It's not even friendly to market makers, as mentioned in Path dependency.\
Looks like we must educate all traders about the benefits of options and invite them to trade these fine instruments. Markets can be made as long as there are enough traders. But that's just another bandaid on an even grimmer headache.\
If you're looking to trade crypto derivatives, there are 2 places to go: CEX and DEX. CEXs are generally faster with more liquidity but you must go through an arduous KYC process and put your funds in the hands of others. DEXs give you more control and freedom but are not nearly as fast or efficient as CEXs. At its current state, blockchain will never be an ideal place for sophisticated or institutional traders commanding huge liquidity who would choose speed over decentralisation and permissionlessness any day. Many DEXs will look to centralise 1 or several links in their protocol such as order book, order matching engine, database, market makers and more to maximize efficiency and attract large institutions with deep pockets. As a result, centralised institutions will have more and more say in these protocols and in the end, they may just turn into on-chain CEXs where decentralisation is nothing but a name.\
Such is the finance industry. When even the slightest edge may put you ahead and rake in billions of dollars, the survivors will look to build higher and higher walls and work with players from all walks to protect their interests. To a newcomer, the world of finance is as much a dark forest as Ethereum is although neither was designed to be initially. Uninitiated individuals will always get eaten alive in such a hostile environment while the survivors feed on their remains and grow into behemoths that are too big to fall. In the end, these financial giants will have immense fun playing with sophisticated, quadruple synthesised products like MBS in an extremely centralised walled garden while the outsiders will do anything for an entry pass.\
Satoshi Nakamoto did invent Bitcoin to battle centralisation but now, the cryptocurrencies may just become another place where institutions take in individuals' funds and throw them one or two bones every now and then.But the future is not all doom and gloom. There surely will be more brilliant minds trying to innovate on perpetual options and evangelising this financial instrument. Options that favour long-term investors with minimal arbitraging opportunities may be invented and blockchain is just an ideal place for them. Account abstraction may eventually bring in hundreds of millions of new users and with them, fragmented liquidity may not be a problem any more. Traders who value decentralisation and privacy will still get to play and grow their own games. A few boutique protocols may survive through the years and eventually be discovered by the masses.\
Looking back, perpetual options may not even be the right answer we are looking for. They are one of the most important derivatives with a spark of crypto innovation but at its current state, it's merely a derivation from a traditional financial instrument that is as far from decentralisation as an empty bucket.

From a report: Google's preliminary copy suggests it's an "AI innovation," though exactly how is unclear. 

Noted software digger Leopeva64 on X found a new offering in the AI settings of a very early build of Chrome. The option, "Automated password Change" (so, early stages -- as to not yet get a copyedit), is described as, "When Chrome finds one of your passwords in a data breach, it can offer to change your password for you when you sign in." 

Chrome already has a feature that warns users if the passwords they enter have been identified in a breach and will prompt them to change it. As noted by Windows Report, the change is that now Google will offer to change it for you on the spot rather than simply prompting you to handle that elsewhere. The password is automatically saved in Google's Password Manager and "is encrypted and never seen by anyone," the settings page claims.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google says it removed cultural events from its calendar last year</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/google-says-it-removed-cultural-events-from-its-calender-in-mid-2024/</link><author>Dominic-Madori Davis</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 20:05:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google has removed events such as Black History Month and Pride Month from being listed on the calendar by default.  Other events that were removed from the default calendar include Jewish Heritage, Indigenous People Month, Holocaust Remembrance Day, and Hispanic Heritage Month.  Google spokesperson Madison Cushman Veld confirmed the changes to TechCrunch, saying that in […]© 2024 TechCrunch.

The report, produced with the University of Chicago's Cyber Policy Initiative, challenges the effectiveness of "red teaming" -- where security experts probe AI systems for vulnerabilities -- saying this approach alone cannot adequately protect against emerging threats. "Public red teaming an AI model is not possible because documentation for what these models are supposed to even do is fragmented and the evaluations we include in the documentation are inadequate," said Sven Cattell, who leads DEF CON's AI Village. 

Nearly 500 participants tested AI models at the conference, with even newcomers successfully finding vulnerabilities. The researchers called for adopting frameworks similar to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system used in traditional cybersecurity since 1999. This would create standardized ways to document and address AI vulnerabilities, rather than relying on occasional security audits.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>3DOS Expands Decentralized Manufacturing With Walrus-Powered AI And Storage</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/3dos-expands-decentralized-manufacturing-with-walrus-powered-ai-and-storage?source=rss</link><author>Chainwire</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 18:51:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Palo Alto, USA, February 11th, 2025/Chainwire/--3DOS, the world’s first decentralized manufacturing network, has selected Walrus as its decentralized storage solution to power its expanding ecosystem of AI-driven manufacturing tools and 3D printing designs.

Today,  announced the first-of-its-kind  framework. SEDA IVMs are a plug-and-play verification solution for interoperability protocols, adding significantly upgraded security, near-instant horizontal scaling, and increased decentralization out of the box.\
Interoperability providers integrating the SEDA IVM can access a hyper-specialized framework for independent, permissionless verification of any cross-chain transaction across all routes. \
The  leverages a multi-layer verification process consisting of an independent overlay network, decentralized solvers, and a combination of private and public RPC data providers. With , the SEDA IVM presents a critical piece of industry-needed security infrastructure. \
Built to offer a robust, scalable, and customizable module, the IVM provides independent decentralized verification for millions of transactions across thousands of networks.Key features and benefits of the SEDA IVM include:Industry-wide data parity with a singular security zone.Built-in liveness guarantees.Programmable design to suit specific needs of bridge, solver, and abstraction layers.Permissionless access and deployments."The demand for robust interoperability infrastructure has surged as users and developers engage with hundreds of specialized networks," said Peter Mitchell, CEO and Co-founder of SEDA. \
"Over the last two years, the interoperability sector has expanded dramatically, achieving a transaction volume of over $123 billion in 2024. Projections indicate this sector could reach over $250 billion in 2025. Our IVMs represent a significant advancement for Interop 3.0, allowing any interoperability provider to customize parameters within the SEDA IVM framework, ensuring independent verification across all routes through a single deployment."\
Parallel to a message relayed between chains, the IVM automatically initiates a secure verification sequence, in which a dedicated secret committee of independent overlay nodes is formed to query RPC data on the source chain. \
Results are returned via a commit-reveal scheme for data integrity and preventing manipulation, after which protocol-defined instructions filter and order results before being batched on SEDA's main chain. \
Data results are secured with tamper-proof cryptographic guarantees before being relayed by solvers to the destination chain.\
By plugging into SEDA’s distributed verification architecture, interoperability providers inherit security and liveness guarantees associated with SEDA’s Network design, consisting of a performant layer one, a highly decentralized overlay network, and a censorship-resistant solver network.\
This design mitigates collusion risk and downtime commonly associated with default multi-sig relay setups, which secure over By decoupling verification, interoperability providers can focus on scaling services to thousands of new chains, allowing SEDA to provide specialized verification for all routes. is a programmable oracle infrastructure that enables builders on any network to connect application-specific data feeds in seconds.:::tip

From a report: All countries taking part in the UN process had been due to send their national climate plans for the next decade by Feb. 10, but relatively few got theirs in on time. Dozens more nations will likely come forward with updated plans within the next nine months before the UN's annual climate summit, known as COP30, kicks off in Brazil. 

The lack of urgency among the more than 170 countries that failed to file what climate diplomats refer to as "nationally determined contributions" (NDCs) adds to concerns about the world's continuing commitment to keeping warming to well below 2C, and ideally 1.5C, relative to pre-industrial levels. Virtually every country adopted those targets a decade ago in the landmark agreement signed in Paris, but a series of lackluster UN summits last year has added to a sense of backsliding. US President Donald Trump has already started the process of pulling the world's second-largest emitter out of the global agreement once again.

But what is behind their success? How did the leading crypto investors, traders, and entrepreneurs achieve their results in this field? In today's article, we will look at the most high-profile success stories that have become an example for other investors and analyze the key factors that allowed them to achieve such impressive results.The First Step to Success: Early InvestmentsProbably everyone in the industry has heard stories at least once about a guy who sold his 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas, or someone who accidentally threw away a hard drive with 8,000 BTC on it. But have you heard the  of the man who accidentally became a Bitcoin millionaire?\
Well, the hero of the story is Kristoffer Koch, a Norwegian engineer who, in 2009, had no idea that his academic curiosity would turn him into a cryptocurrency millionaire. When the price of 1 Bitcoin was even less than $1, Koch was working on his dissertation on encryption. Interested in the potential of the decentralized digital currency, he decided to invest $22-$27, purchasing approximately 5000 BTC. At the time, Bitcoin was unpopular, so Koch's investment was more of a technical study than a financial one. Immediately afterward, the man forgot about his small investment and lived his usual life, not paying attention to the changes around digital assets.\
However, everything changed in 2013, when the price of the first cryptocurrency experienced a significant jump, attracting the attention of many investors. So, when all the headlines in the media were about Bitcoin and its $200 price, the engineer remembered his long-forgotten investment. When he accessed his wallet, he discovered that his wealth was about $886,000. However, Koch did not succumb to the madness of his newfound wealth but made a practical decision by purchasing a new apartment for a portion of his Bitcoins.\
Given his story, two main strategies led to a successful outcome. The first is the initial coin offering (ICO), when investors invest in projects at the start-up stage, allowing them to make a significant profit if they are successful. The second, albeit random, in his case is HODL. The essence of this strategy is to buy cryptocurrencies for long-term storage in anticipation of a significant increase in value.From $30 a Day to a Million: How the DCA Strategy Changed the Investor's LifeAnother investment success story: a user with the nickname regothetrader turned a daily investment of $30 into a portfolio worth $1 million in almost 8 years. At the age of 22, he started his strategy of gradual Bitcoin purchases. Every 12 hours, regardless of the asset's exchange rate, Rego invested $30.\
Talking about his  on social network X, he admitted that such discipline required personal sacrifice: ‘I sacrificed going out with my friends to allocate to this belief. I stayed home. I didn't buy a new car. I didn't buy fancy things. I kept it minimal.’\
On 13 November, he announced that his persistent DCA strategy had brought in $1,000,000 in 7 years, 10 months, and 12 days. In total, Rego has invested $86,370 in cryptocurrency.\
‘The truth is, Bitcoin is not a risk, it is a matter of understanding. The more you learn about it, the more obvious it becomes.’ the investor emphasized.\
The dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy involves spreading purchases over predetermined intervals, regardless of price. According to a  conducted by , 59% of investors use DCA as their primary investment strategy. Among the most common reasons they cite are hedging against market volatility, maintaining consistent investment habits, and eliminating emotions in trading.Know Your Product: The Role of Research and KnowledgeMost of the success stories are about young investors, but one of the most incredible stories is about a teenager who started investing when he was just 12 years old.\
Erik Finman is an ordinary guy who managed to turn his Bitcoin investments into a huge fortune by the time he was 18. His family was not wealthy, but Eric's life changed when his grandmother gave him $1000. As he had always been interested in technology and innovation, he learned about Bitcoin in 2011. Seeing the potential of the new digital currency, Eric decided to invest his $1000 and bought his first Bitcoins with it. At that time, the world was skeptical about cryptocurrencies, and the asset itself was trading at only $12 per coin.\
For the next few years, Eric studied and gradually traded coins. At the age of 15, after falling out with his parents over his unwillingness to continue his studies at school, he decided to sell some of his investments. Having received $100,000, he invested it in his first business, which he started in his room. Finman really disliked going to school, so he created his own company, Botangle, where teachers conducted their classes online. After 2 years, he decided to sell his business for 300 BTC. So, when the first cryptocurrency rate exceeded $2700, 17-year-old Erik Finman became a millionaire.\
Looking at Finman's story, one can understand that he used similar strategies as Koch. However, their approach to business was different. Finman was a curious guy, so he dove deep into the world of cryptocurrencies, learning everything he could about Bitcoin and blockchain technology. He didn't just invest blindly; he decided to research the market, study trends, and understand Bitcoin's full potential.Investors on the Wave: How the Launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA Generated Million-Dollar ProfitsFollowing the recent inauguration of US President Donald Trump, the crypto industry has been rocked by a wave of new profit stories. The reason for this was the launch of the $TRUMP meme coin on 17 January. The value of the coin skyrocketed from $0.18 to $3.7 after the launch announcement. Within an hour of the launch, one trader managed to earn $20 million. According to  analysts, about 90 seconds after the announcement, the trader spent ~$1.1 million USDC, purchasing 5.97 million $TRUMP. A few hours later, these tokens were valued at over $116 million.\
Later, the trader decided to distribute his assets among 10 different Solana wallets and began to gradually sell the coins the next day. According to the research company Bubblemaps, by the morning of Monday, January 20, he had  $85 million worth of TRUMP, leaving $75 million worth of tokens. However, this was not the end of his story, as First Lady Melania Trump followed her husband's example and issued her own meme coin, which was used by the trader. One of the wallets associated with the user bought a huge amount of MELANIA tokens a minute and a half after Melania's post on Truth Social. To finance the purchase of MELANIA, the trader sold $45 million worth of TRUMP, which led to a drop in the token's value of almost 50% on Sunday evening, according to Bubblemaps.\
Other anonymous traders who made millions on the First Lady's tokens did not go unnoticed, either. One of them  2,500 SOL ($688,000) to buy 5.2 million MELANIA for $0.13 and sold them four days later, earning a profit of 6208%, or $42.7 million.\
The stories of these anonymous traders once again emphasize the importance of early investment.

An altcoin, or alternative coin, is a cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin. Altseasons are usually driven by a shift in the liquidity of the crypto market.\
Due to the bullish sentiments of the crypto market during pre-altseasons, investors tend to search for more profitable opportunities in the market, shifting their attention from Bitcoin (BTC) to other promising altcoins.\
This shift in investors' attention and interest often results in an increased flow of liquidity or money from Bitcoin to altcoins, causing their prices to rise, and their outperforming Bitcoin.\
Conversely, Bitcoin season is a period when Bitcoin outperforms altcoins. Due to Bitcoin’s status as digital gold, investors tend to shift their focus from altcoins to Bitcoin, especially when the market is bearish, resulting in the prices of altcoins falling significantly.The first altseason occurred between 2017 and 2018. Bitcoin’s market dominance dropped significantly during this period, falling from 87% to 32%. Conversely, altcoins rose in value. This surge was a result of the ICO boom.\
An ICO, or Initial Coin Offering, is a fundraising method used by blockchain companies to finance their projects. A blockchain company often sells its tokens to investors in exchange for capital. The logic behind this was that these tokens' prices would rise upon the project's launch.\
Notable ICOs launched during this period included Ethereum, Tron, and Polkadot. The ICO boom resulted in several altcoins reaching their all-time highs, including Ether (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC). Conversely, Bitcoin experienced a significant decline, dropping from its peak price of over $20,000 to less than $6,000.The next altseason occurred between 2020 and 2021. The opportunity to explore other aspects of blockchain technology was the main driver of this altseason. It was during this period decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and memecoins became popular.\
According to , approximately $189 billion was locked in DeFi protocols by the end of 2021, a 767% increase over 2020.\
The NFT market also skyrocketed. According to , approximately $2.57 billion worth of NFT art was sold in 2021, up from $20 million in 2020, representing a 12,750% increase.\
Memecoins were not left out, as meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) gained significant popularity during this period.\
All these significantly affected the altcoin market, causing it to rise from 30% to 62%. The crypto market also reached an all-time high of $3 trillion. On the other hand, Bitcoin dominance dropped, falling from 70% to 30%.Signs That an Altcoin Season Has StartedIncrease in Altcoin DominanceOne major sign that an altcoin season has started is the increase in altcoin dominance, which is the percentage of the total crypto market cap made up of altcoins.\
It is calculated by subtracting Bitcoin dominance from 100%, that is: Altcoin dominance = 100% – Bitcoin dominance.  You can get the Bitcoin dominance value in real-time by checking crypto aggregator sites like  and .Trading volume is the total amount of a cryptocurrency that is traded (bought and sold) on a crypto exchange within a given time period.  Due to the increase in the flow of liquidity from Bitcoin to altcoins, the trading volume of altcoins tends to increase during altseasons. Thus, an increase in the trading volume of altcoins is a good sign an altseason is about to begin.Increase in Altcoin Season Index and Ethereum-to-Bitcoin Price Ratio (ETH/BTC)\
The altcoin season index is a metric used to determine how well altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 30-, 60-, or 90-day period. Its value can be reliably used to predict if an altseason has started.\
If the altcoin season index is between 0 and 25, it indicates Bitcoin is dominating the crypto market. If it is between 25 and 75, it means the crypto market is experiencing a mixed performance.\
If, however, the altcoin season index is between 75 and 100, it means altcoins are outperforming Bitcoins, indicating an altseason.\
The ETH/BTC price ratio can also be used to determine an altseason. A rising ETH/BTC ratio means Ether (ETH) outperforms Bitcoin (BTC), a trigger that might lead to an altseasonHow to Benefit From an Altcoin Season?Research and Diversify Your PortfolioThough altseasons can be profitable, they can also be risky, as a trader or investor might end up purchasing an altcoin that performs poorly. That’s why it’s important you research before investing in any altcoin.\
To begin your research, you can use website tools like Coinmarketcap and Coingecko to check the metrics of an altcoin, including its dominance, trading volume, and market cap.\
While researching is important, do not forget an important aspect of investing—diversification. Diversifying your crypto portfolio is important as it helps mitigate the risks associated with the volatility of the crypto market.\
Are you looking for the best platform that offers a variety of altcoins to help diversify your crypto portfolio? MEXC is your best deal.\
In addition to being one of the best and most reliable cryptocurrency exchanges, here are some of the benefits of using MEXC:With over 3,000 tokens listed and new listings occurring almost daily, MEXC stands out from other cryptocurrency exchanges by offering the most cryptocurrency collections. Its efficient infrastructure and well-organized listing process allow it to list cryptocurrencies swiftly and early. Thus, investors can acquire lesser-known and emerging cryptocurrency tokens even before they are listed on other exchanges.Liquidity is a key feature of the MEXC exchange platform. According to industry reports, , having a spot trading depth of $3.11 billion. It also has a futures depth of over $9.1 billion, surpassing the total of major exchanges. \
With its high liquidity and extremely low slippage, MEXC provides a favorable trading environment that allows traders to execute trades swiftly and efficiently. Little wonder, it is the crypto hub of more than 30 million users from over 170 countries.Extremely Low Trading FeeAnother unique benefit of the MEXC crypto exchange is its extremely low trading fees. MEXC offers a 0.05% taker fee for spot trading and a 0.01% maker and 0.04% taker fee for futures trading. The result? Traders can maximize profits during altseasons.\
Due to its exceptional services, MEXC has become the go-to crypto exchange for millions of users, achieving ground-breaking milestones.\
To illustrate with examples, here are two of MEXC’s achievements this past year:Ranking among the top centralized exchanges (CEXs) for spot and derivative trading.According to the data obtained from Token Insight, MEXC ranked 6th and 5th among CEXs for spot trading and derivative trading in 2024. \
In fact, its derivative trading volume increased by 132.35%, more than twice its 2023 volume. This is quite remarkable, highlighting MEXC’s hgh liquidity, wide user base, and diverse crypto offerings that cater to the needs of all kinds of traders.\
Thus, traders can easily buy cryptocurrencies, including memecoins, with minimal price slippage. MEXC also offers futures and margin trading options that allows traders to benefit from the price volatility of cryptocurrencies, including memecoins.Having the largest market share among CEXs.Market share refers to the proportion of trading activity a cryptocurrency exchange has compared to other exchanges. \
This says a lot about MEXC’s trust and reputation.

Technical analysis instruments like support and resistance levels and the relative strength index, can help determine entry and exit points.\
Setting up stop-loss and take-profits levels is also a proactive step to minimizing loss.Nothing beats being early. To refine your investment strategy, consider participating in token presales. Visiting the MEXC website for new listings also allows you to purchase new altcoins before they are listed on other exchanges.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hit The Snooze on Cache Keys and How It Boosts Web App Performance</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/hit-the-snooze-on-cache-keys-and-how-it-boosts-web-app-performance?source=rss</link><author>Alex Svetkin</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:58:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Using an in-memory side cache to improve response times and alleviate the load on a database is one of the most common design patterns seen in web applications. This design scales well and has low setup and maintenance costs. A side cache can be added to an existing web application backend to speed up the loading of all types of data, from database records to larger chunks like complete JSON or HTML responses. By setting an expiration time, "lazy caching” (or “lazy loading”) can be implemented, meeting the user's tolerance for stale data without the complexities of cache invalidation. Many excellent open-source solutions are available both on-premises and in the cloud, memcache and redis are considered the most popular. A caching scheme like this has been used in all the projects I have worked on.\
As system load increases, challenges inevitably emerge. Imagine your web application processing millions of requests daily. During peak traffic hours, users experience significant delays and occasional errors. To mitigate these issues, you expand your caching infrastructure by adding additional instances, expecting the increased cache size to resolve the bottlenecks. However, the performance issues persist, and your application continues to struggle under the load. This scenario, which I encountered repeatedly in the projects I worked on, necessitates a careful re-evaluation of our approach to caching under high demand.Large technology companies often address such challenges with sophisticated software and intricate architectural changes. However, these solutions are not always accessible or cost-effective for smaller teams or organizations. Techniques such as implementing middleware proxies for request batching or adopting customized communication protocols may not align with your system's constraints. This article presents a practical method that my colleagues and I successfully employed to address similar challenges in large-scale projects.Latency spikes at top percentilesOne of the frequent problems we encountered was high response times observed in top percentiles like p99, while mean and median times looked great. These high response times occurred due to the need to make database reads when cache keys were missing.I created a simulation to represent a typical workload for a web application we used to have (see the Simulation section below for more details). This model application handles 100 requests per second for a single type of abstract key. The keys' popularity follows a Pareto distribution, with two-thirds of user requests concentrated among the first 1,000 keys out of a total of 1 million keys.Mean cache read time is about 50 times higher than database read time. Cache expiration time is 20 minutes.The p99 response times for these top 1000 keys are extremely high (top left chart), while the mean and median response times are within an acceptable threshold. The long tail of less popular keys isn’t considered here because their hit ratio is significantly lower, thus making caching much less efficient for them beforehand.\
But are high values at 99th percentile for popular keys that bad? That means that just about 1% of key reads are slow. Though it depends on your application and its usage patterns, this is generally unfavourable. Think about the following real-world scenarios:A single user's request fetches hundreds of keys — a typical case for social and news feeds etc. Though only 1 out of 100 keys are slow but almost every user request is slow because of that;Hundreds of users request the same key at the same moment — a common thing pattern for any popular site. When this key expires, all these requests go straight to the database, multiplying its load, slowing down the whole backend.I want to emphasize that this happens not to “some requests” but to the most popular ones, which represent the core of your users’ demand.Setting keys expiration time to infinity could solve the problem with peaking loading times. Unfortunately, this also denies “lazy caching” and demands cache invalidation mechanisms.  Is it possible to eliminate the issue of key expiration while still providing data that is acceptably up to date?Dynamically extending keys expiration timeThe desire to serve fresh data while maintaining low response times and database load is inherently contradictory. The ideal solution would be to know in advance if a retrieved key from the cache is about to expire and update it if necessary, preferably in the background. Here is an example solution written in pseudo-python code:cache_response = cache.get(key)
if cache_response is not None: 
  if random() < α:
    run async: # this block will run in background and not delay the response
      db_response = dabase.get(key)
      if db_response is not None:
          # note cas_token, see explanation for CAS below
          cache.set(key, db_response.value, cache_response.cas_token) 

  # returning value to the user
  return cache_response.value 
\
We read a key from cache and, if successful, with small probability set its value again, also extending the expiration time. This involves reading the key from the database to check for updates.To avoid race conditions, CAS or Check and Set mode must be used. CAS ensures that the cache update only happens if the data hasn't been modified by another process since it was last read, maintaining data consistency.The key set should be done asynchronously to avoid delaying user responses. Even if it isn't possible, it may be still beneficial to update the key blocking the user.Choosing the optimal probability  depends on your traffic pattern and is generally recommended to be between 1% and 10%. Higher values increase database load without significantly affecting popular keys.\
In systems where keys are not frequently updated, expiration times are longer, and request rates are high, an additional strategy can be implemented. Keys may be updated with probability α, but only if their remaining expiration time is below .This technique requires the ability to read the expiration time. Redis provides the  command for this purpose, while memcache does not. This can be addressed by storing the expiration time alongside the value, for example, packed in JSON.Modifying caching behavior of your system in production is risky, to say the least, so it's safer to apply changes gradually. However, due to the unpredictable nature of the incoming traffic, distinguishing small improvements from noise requires complex data analysis. Development or staging environments proved to be not much better in my cases as they had lower traffic.To tackle this, I used discrete simulation tools for ad-hoc simulations. This approach allowed me to safely test any system behavior I wanted to research much faster than running such experiments in a development environment.While I was composing this article, I compiled numerous code snippets utilized during these experiments into a single tool and made it available through a github repository: https://github.com/whisk/cachestudy.The expiration time extension technique I described in this article shows that improving web application performance doesn’t always require expensive tools or complex changes. By addressing common caching challenges developers can significantly boost efficiency and handle high traffic with simple, cost-effective solutions.\
However, these improvements must be carefully tested in production environments to ensure they work as intended and don’t create new problems. Simulations and pre-production environments often lack the complexity and scale of real-world traffic, and only by testing under actual conditions can you ensure your optimizations provide tangible gains without introducing new issues.Cover image generated by DALL·E.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Space Economy: Trends of Advanced Development</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/new-space-economy-trends-of-advanced-development?source=rss</link><author>NFT Bro</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:51:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
In continuation of the topic raised in the last article, I decided to conduct a study of the space industry development based on the concept of “new space economy”.\
==The new space economy is a global trend based on a number of technological innovations and a certain business model. According to Morgan Stanley, this industry can already be valued at $350 billion and could reach $1 trillion by 2040. This opens up new opportunities for the automotive, tourism, energy, telecommunications, transportation, and other important industries to increase their profitability or improve the structure of work on Earth or in space.==The main prerequisites for my research were:Strong growth of companies and new technological solutions in the space industry;Decreasing cost of transportation to Earth orbit;Growth in the number of spacecraft;The explosive growth of the space economy and its interrelationships with Earth-based industry and economy;Application of industrial and IT innovations to the space industry;Unpredictable revolutionary changes in economic models in the space-Earth nexus (black swans).I have also identified the most promising technologies for the “new space economy” and these are:Spacecraft mass production;Serial production of ultra-light rockets for constellation replenishment and low-orbit launches;Heavy and super-heavy rockets for launching payloads into high orbits and launches to the Moon;High-power autonomous power supply systems (up to 500 kW);Laser communication and navigation systems for long-range communications;Autonomous satellites and rovers;New types of engines, including those that do not require reactive mass or significantly reduce its consumption, allow for constant operation both in low orbits and in space;New materials for various systems (protective, heat dissipating, etc);Electronic component base (including radiation-resistant) increasing computing performance in space (spacecraft, rovers, stations, and in the future on orbital data centers);New types of energy-efficient sensors and systems based on them;Technologies of autonomous production (robotization, additive technologies, AI, new materials processing technologies, etc.).\
Based on this, I conclude the main trends of advanced development.Main trends of advanced development for SpaceTechMultifunctional autonomous heavy platforms and satellites with universal (typified) connectors and data exchange protocols. Unified standards for all satellites and bases for compatibility of various assemblies and designs. Development of the principles of modular construction of satellites (spacecraft) and stations (automated and manned) for space and satellite surfaces. This will provide the unification of technical solutions and the possibility of building complex technical systems without being tied to a country or a manufacturing company.A unified network of communication, navigation, and space traffic control based on AI. Creation of a unified system of space traffic dispatching in the Earth-Moon space with integration of all participants of space exploration programs. ExtraNet is a unified network of data collection, storage, and transmission in space. Extraterritorial principle of access to information, acceleration of data processing for space applications. Verified settlement system using blockchain technologies.==Extraterritoriality of space law, new regulations, and legislation.== ==Freedom of data exchange and settlement in space. Development of the ideology of humanity as a single nation. New principles of governance and cohabitation.==Creation of a new space economy based on goods and services produced in space and their consumption in space. Multiple growth of interaction of Earth industry and economy with space industry and economy.New energy-efficient technologies and solutions adaptable for Earth applications. Biotechnology, new pharmaceuticals, biomaterials printing, photonic processors, superconductivity, magnetic levitation, automated factories and robotic mining systems, robotic shipyards using additive technologies (3D printing of structures and spacecraft in microgravity), autonomous rovers and harvesters.Achieving self-sustainability of space systems. Extraction of minerals and necessary resources for life support systems. Waste recycling technologies and self-sustaining closed ecosystems of bases and stations.Creation of new logistic chains. I mean ==Low orbits / high orbits / geostationary orbits / Lagrange points / Luna using autonomous satellites (tugs)== with long operating times to reduce the cost of transportation. Using AI, creating a network of automatic stations for dispatching and traffic control to reduce accidents (avoiding the Kessler effect). Protection from radiation and space radiation, new alloys (produced in microgravity). Discovery of new chemical elements and compounds and creation of materials with their application.International Space University. Working with the “Big Challenges,” embodiment of the idea of “Mega Science” by taking science and research beyond jurisdictions, hosting on a platform with hosting space infrastructure allows for development trends on interdisciplinarity, openness, and digitalization.  The use of an extraterritorial payment system will make it possible to obtain funding for research outside national institutions. Creation of new training systems for professionals and scientists for the industry through continuously updated digital training programs and practice with real cases.Synergetic revolutionary change of business models of the Earth economy. This will happen with the participation of the space economy. For example, industrial mining of platinum on asteroids will create an economically sound industry of hydrogen transport and hydrogen fuel cells for independent energy supply, which will remove electric transport and wind and solar energy. Another example is hydrocarbon extraction on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, which will increase the Earth's economy by 1000 times.==, we will see the expansion of mankind in the solar system and the expansion of the zone of life.==\
All this will allow us to create completely new technical systems and production directions, as well as significantly expand the capabilities of existing industries.Possible directions of development for Space Tech\
Let's consider possible directions of development.Creation of an infrastructure for access to energy supply anywhere in the solar systemFor this project, all existing energy generation systems will be used, which will complement each other and give impetus to the technological development of autonomous energy supply systems (solar panels, nuclear technologies, energy storage systems). New solutions for wireless energy transmission in a vacuum.Automated transportation networksThis includes Orbital and space tugs using new types of plasma and ion engines. Development and application of new types of fuels. Automated refueling, repair, and upgrade stations (GateWay's). Dispatching of movement in near-Earth, near-lunar, and outer space using AI on the basis of orbital and space data centers. New chains and principles of logistics in high Earth orbit, near-lunar space, on the Moon and in the Solar System (Separation of transportation services by orbits and Earth-Moon paths).Laser communication systems and high-precision positioning systems. Positioning stations in space in 3-dimensional coordinate system (space and lunar navigation). Remote control of UAV drones by operators from Earth for complex tasks.Automated stations with customizable production cycle and standardized modules for equipment placement. Incorporating manufacturing facilities into new supply chains. 3D printing of space structures and spacecraft in microgravity using automated drones. Alloys and materials are produced only in microgravity. Technologies for creating self-sustaining ecosystems (waste management, water and air purification, food and medicine production). Cultivation of extremely pure and harmonized crystals.Automated geological probes/automated and robotic mining systems. Base station with a power core, data center, and long-distance communication node+robotic drones for mining and primary processing of resources. Typical modules for automated and manned stations in space and on the surface of the Moon will also develop. Then, on the surfaces of satellites and asteroids. Rapid development of all planets and asteroids, with the construction of international settlements.Creation of digital automated diagnostic complexes on the basis of historical datasets on changes in human condition in space, diagnostic techniques, and preventive methods with the application of AI. Development of treatment programs in microgravity conditions. Growing biomaterials in microgravity/bioprinting, operations in microgravity (automated robotic operating complexes, remote control of medical complexes).Unified network of data collection, storage, and transmission outside the EarthThis includes Orbital data centers, data centers on the Moon, and space stations. Radiation-resistant electronic components. Photonic processors.Recent events show that it is time for mankind to go out into the solar system and master it in full. Even already existing technologies are sufficient for the united expansion of mankind into space. Development of asteroids can significantly improve life on Earth (for example, obtaining platinum at the price of aluminum will revolutionize the entire transportation industry, replacing gasoline and diesel with hydrogen) and increase the size of the economy by thousands of times. Establishing full-fledged settlements on other planets and satellites will expand the range of human habitation. The creation of new materials, the development of medicine and pharmaceutics, and the development of new technologies in space will allow us to go further into other star systems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EU Pledges $200 Billion in AI Spending in Bid To Catch Up With US, China</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/02/11/1617259/eu-pledges-200-billion-in-ai-spending-in-bid-to-catch-up-with-us-china?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:50:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The European Union pledged to mobilize 200 billion euros ($206.15 billion) to invest in AI as the bloc seeks to catch up with the U.S. and China in the race to train the most complex models. From a report: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the bloc wants to supercharge its ability to compete with the U.S. and China in AI. The plan -- dubbed InvestAI -- includes a new 20 billion-euro fund for so-called AI gigafactories, facilities that rely on powerful chips to train the most complex AI models. "We want Europe to be one of the leading AI continents, and this means embracing a life where AI is everywhere," von der Leyen said at the AI Action Summit in Paris. 

The announcement underscores efforts from the EU to position itself as a key player in the AI race. The bloc has been lagging behind the U.S. and China since OpenAI's 2022 release of ChatGPT ushered in a spending bonanza. [...] The EU is aiming to establish gigafactories to train the most complex and large AI models. Those facilities will be equipped with roughly 100,000 last-generation AI chips, around four times more than the number installed in the AI factories being set up right now.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TapSwap To Be Listed On Bitget: A Gateway To Long-Term Success</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/tapswap-to-be-listed-on-bitget-a-gateway-to-long-term-success?source=rss</link><author>BTCWire</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:45:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Mark Your Calendars: February 14, 2025We’re thrilled to announce that TapSwap, the world’s first Web3 skill-gaming platform, is taking a giant leap forward with its listing on Bitget on February 14, 2025. \

Markets have expanded into real-world assets (RWAs), perpetual futures, and FX, but the actual experience of trading across these assets is full of friction.\
Traders deal with fragmented liquidity, collateral stuck in staking contracts, and a system that still revolves around USD stablecoins.\
 is fixing this by launching an Integrated DEX with LST & Perp Futures for FX RWAs. By combining liquid staking RWAs with a Perpetual Futures DEX, Cables enables assets like cEUR, cJPY, and cXAU to function as both collateral and tradable instruments, eliminating the inefficiencies of fragmented liquidity.\
Instead of forcing participants to move liquidity across different protocols, Cables connects yield, collateral, and trade execution in a single system—powering the Cables Liquidity Flywheel.\
This self-reinforcing cycle allows the Cables Community to deposit anything, earn yield on anything, and trade or leverage it without friction.\
Cables recently  and , outlining how it will seamlessly integrate RWAs into DeFi 2.0. With a focus on building for the Cables Community—not just users—this next evolution of DeFi puts accessibility, liquidity, and global adoption at the forefront.DeFi Still Feels Like Using a Flip Phone in 2025For all its advancements, DeFi still feels outdated. Traders looking to hedge non-USD currencies, earn yield on real-world assets, or trade multiple markets often end up bouncing between different platforms, waiting on bridges, and converting back to USD just to execute trades.\
Liquidity is scattered across different chains, making it harder to enter and exit positions efficiently. Assets that should be usable in trading are locked in staking contracts, leaving traders to choose between earning passive yield or keeping capital available.\
And for those looking to trade outside the USD-dominated system, choices are limited—most DeFi pairs still revolve around USDT or USDC, forcing FX traders into unnecessary conversions.\
DeFi shouldn’t just be about adding more assets. It should be about making them usable in real markets. That’s where Cables’ launch of its Integrated LST & Perpetual Futures for FX RWAs in one DEX will dominate and show the world what DeFi 2.0 truly means.Cables’ Integrated LST & Perpetual Futures for FX RWAs in One DEXCables Finance is solving this by making liquid staking RWAs a core piece of trading infrastructure. With liquid staking, the Cables Community doesn’t have to choose between earning yield and accessing deep, liquid markets. Assets like cEUR, cJPY, and cXAU remain liquid, earning yield while serving as active collateral on the Cables Perp DEX.\
A trader looking to hedge euro exposure can hold cEUR, collect yield, and use it for leveraged positions at the same time. A gold-backed stable asset like cXAU provides access to a decentralized gold market while acting as collateral.\
Instead of unstaking funds or swapping between isolated liquidity pools, the Cables Community can trade, hedge, and earn in one place.This approach removes unnecessary steps from DeFi trading. Instead of shifting liquidity between staking and active markets, capital can move freely within a single system.Cables Finance: The Trading Desk DeFi Actually NeedsThe future of DeFi isn’t just about adding assets—it’s about making them work for traders. Liquid staking RWAs allow traders to keep assets active while earning yield, removing the trade-offs that exist today.\
Cables Finance combines deep liquidity with perpetual futures, creating a trading system where RWAs aren’t just passive holdings—they’re part of an active, high-volume market. Instead of treating RWAs as an afterthought, Cables puts them at the core of DeFi 2.0 trading.\
DeFi has spent years making assets tradable. Now, Cables Finance is making trading better—with a Liquidity Flywheel that connects deposit, yield, and leverage in one system.DeFi 2.0 is here. The Cables Community is building it.:::tip

From a report: Meta workers who were let go were notified via email, and the company is offering US-based employees severance packages that include 16 weeks of salary, in addition two weeks for each year of service, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the details weren't public. Employees whose review merited a bonus will still get one, and staff will still receive stock awards as part of the upcoming vesting cycle later this month, the people said. 

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg told employees that Meta would cut 5% of its workforce -- as many 3,600 people -- with a focus on staff who "aren't meeting expectations," Bloomberg News first reported in mid-January. Affected US-based employees would be notified on Feb. 10, while international employees could learn later, Zuckerberg said last month. In a separate message to managers, the Facebook co-founder said the cuts would create headcount for the company to hire the "strongest talent."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The HackerNoon Newsletter: AI Coding Tools Are Still in the RD Stage (2/11/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/2-11-2025-newsletter?source=rss</link><author>Noonification</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:05:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🪐 What’s happening in tech today, February 11, 2025?By @andrei9735 [ 7 Min read ] In this post well continue working on link prediction with the Twitch dataset.

: This contribution draws attention to implications connected with meta-architectural design decisions for intelligent tutoring systems in the context of formative assessments. As a first result of addressing this issue, this contribution presents a meta-architectural system design that includes the role of educators.According to an ongoing systematic literature review and similar reviews that have already been conducted [1–3], we see evidence that intelligent tutoring systems are developed from a conceptual perspective in a black-box manner for the actual participants of educational assessment scenarios.\
This emphasizes the necessity to examine system designs, employed algorithms, and the conceptual implementation of pedagogical-psychological models in intelligent tutoring systems to enhance explainability and transparency for all stakeholders. A first step to do so is to reflect on intelligent tutoring systems beyond their current borders and to question:\
RQ1: How can we incorporate the role of educators into meta-architectural designs of intelligent tutoring systems to foster their explainability and transparency?Competency-based learning (or competency-based education and related synonyms as discussed in [4]) refers to a pedagogical approach that supports the development of practical skills and behaviors that are necessary for success in real-world situations [5, 6]. A revised definition of competency-based learning distinguishes this concept into seven major aspects [6, 7]. Two of these aspects address the assessment of competencies: "…(2) assessment is meaningful, timely, relevant, and actionable evidence; … (4) students’ assessment is based on evidence of mastery; [6, p.1904]"(retrieved from Levine & Patrick [7]).\
Formative assessments are a major form of assessing competencies [8–11]. Usually, these kinds of assessments are typically incremental [9, 10, 12] and inform not only learners about their current state but also educators about the effectiveness of their pedagogical and didactical methods [11]. To design, develop, and implement formative assessments, various methodologies have been developed to derive these information for educators, for example, the ADDIE Model [13], Four – Component Instructional Design (4C/ID) [14] or the Evidence Centered-Design Framework (ECD) [15].\
The ECD is based on the idea that when learners fulfill tasks, they create some kind of result (work product) that incorporates, to some degree, the learner’s competence level [16]. Hence, extracting evidence from the work products within a defined evidence identification process leads to claims about certain competencies [15, 17, 18]. Collecting and storing these beliefs result in an individual description of each learner, a learner model. Thus, before constructing the actual assessment, it is necessary to reflect on all those stated parts and other aspects as well [15].\
Educators usually act in a similar (but far less formal) way to develop and apply formative assessments in their educational settings, which costs them a lot of time. A recent McKinsey study ([19]) with a focus on K-12 teachers in the US, UK, CA, and SG reveals that they spend 34% of their time on preparation, evaluation, and feedback tasks [19, 20].\
Hence, researchers and developers have been eager to tailor computer-based learning experiences to the learner´s needs by using evidence about competencies to adapt the learning process autonomously [21– 23]. To achieve this, such systems incorporate learner models, task (or more general domain) models, and automated evidence identification processes and use those to generate adaption recommendations. Examples of conceptional formulations for such systems could be recommending the next best-fitting learning object (e.g., a task with a specific difficulty), finding a sequence of novel courses, or supporting the search for learning peers [24, 25].\
Nowadays, advanced systems are able to mimic the behaviors of human tutors by using artificial intelligence, which results in their classification as intelligent tutoring systems [26, 27]. To do so, these systems not only incorporate learner models and domain models but also so-called tutor models. The tutor model is the decision entity that schedules pedagogical or didactical interventions according to the state of the learner model as a response to the learner’s interaction [28]. As a result of this perspective, intelligent tutoring systems are designed and developed according to the meta-architectural approach illustrated by the gray elements in Figure 1 (see [26, 28–30]).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dual-Arm HyQReal Puts Powerful Telepresence Anywhere</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/telepresence-robot</link><author>Evan Ackerman</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjE1MDg3MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MzQyMjI5MH0.P7rZYSa6orpvLiwnLpf8wHNCw_oa4ckp2iPAj5ykgLg/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:00:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[IIT’s hydraulic quadruped can carry a pair of massive arms]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Before AI Predicts Your Next Friend, It Needs to Do This First</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/before-ai-predicts-your-next-friend-it-needs-to-do-this-first?source=rss</link><author>Andrei</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this post we'll continue working on link prediction with the Twitch dataset: we'll export the graph data from the Neptune DB cluster to an S3 bucket using the neptune-export utility provided by AWS. We'll choose the 'neptune_ml' profile when we create the data export task and the utility will create the 'training-data-configuration.json' file that we'll use later in the pipeline. The exported data will be ready for feature encoding and data processing, which is the next step required for link prediction.We start with the graph data that we have in Neptune DB after uploading the lists of vertices and edges using the Neptune Bulk Loader API (as described in Part 1 of this guide).\
The vertices represent users. All vertices contain the same set of properties, and a single vertex looks like this:{<T.id: 1>: '153', <T.label: 4>: 'user', 'days': 1629, 'mature': True, 'views': 3615, 'partner': False}
\
All edges have the same label ('follows'), each edge connects 2 users. A single edge looks like this:{<T.id: 1>: '0', <T.label: 4>: 'follows', <Direction.IN: 'IN'>: {<T.id: 1>: '255', <T.label: 4>: 'user'}, <Direction.OUT: 'OUT'>: {<T.id: 1>: '6194', <T.label: 4>: 'user'}}
\
Our goal is to export the data so that it can be used in the next part of our data pipeline: preprocessing and feature encoding.RUNNING THE NEPTUNE-EXPORT UTILITY ON EC2We'll use the  utility provided by AWS to export data from the database. To allow the utility access to the DB, we'll run it on an EC2 instance inside the VPC where the Neptune DB cluster is. The utility will get the data from the DB, save it in local storage (an EBS volume), and then it will upload the exported data to S3.\
Although AWS provides a Cloudformation template that deploys a private API inside your VPC to allow the export process to be started with an HTTP request, we won't focus on that this time. As our goal is to demonstrate how the data pipeline works (and not to set up an API), we'll just use the EC2 instance's console to interact with the neptune-export utility. By the way, those console commands can be automated with AWS Systems Manager Run Command and Step Functions.\
Let's create the EC2 instance that we'll run neptune-export on. For AMI, we choose Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. We need to make sure that the Neptune cluster is reachable from the EC2 instance, so we'll create the instance in the same VPC where the Neptune cluster is, and we'll configure the security groups to allow network traffic between the instance and the cluster. We also need to attach an EBS volume of sufficient size to contain the exported data. For the dataset that we're working on, an 8GB volume is enough.\
While the instance is starting, we need to create an IAM role that allows write access to the destination S3 bucket, and also some RDS actions, as it is shown in the policy below. While the first statement of the policy is mandatory, the second one is only needed if you export data from a cloned cluster. Exporting data from cloned clusters will be be discussed later in this post.{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "RequiredPart",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rds:ListTagsForResource",
                "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
                "rds:DescribeDBClusters"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "OptionalPartOnlyRequiredForExportingFromClonedCluster",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rds:AddTagsToResource",
                "rds:DescribeDBClusters",
                "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
                "rds:ListTagsForResource",
                "rds:DescribeDBClusterParameters",
                "rds:DescribeDBParameters",
                "rds:ModifyDBParameterGroup",
                "rds:ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup",
                "rds:RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime",
                "rds:DeleteDBInstance",
                "rds:DeleteDBClusterParameterGroup",
                "rds:DeleteDBParameterGroup",
                "rds:DeleteDBCluster",
                "rds:CreateDBInstance",
                "rds:CreateDBClusterParameterGroup",
                "rds:CreateDBParameterGroup"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
You can allow access to just the target cluster (instead of all clusters) by editing the ‘Resource’ field.\
The role must also have a trust policy that allows EC2 to assume the role:{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
Once the EC2 instance and the role is ready, we'll attach the role to the instance.\
Next, we need to install the neptune-export utility on the instance. To do that, we’ll log into the instance and use these commands to install JDK 8 and download the utility:sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y openjdk-8-jdk
curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-neptune-customer-samples/neptune-export/bin/neptune-export.jar
Now that we've prepared the EC2 instance, the destination S3 bucket, and attached the IAM the role that allows write access to the destination S3 bucket to the instance, we can start exporting data. We'll use this command to initiate the process, providing the required parameters as a JSON object:java -jar /home/ubuntu/neptune-export.jar nesvc \
  --root-path /home/ubuntu/neptune-export \
  --json '{
    "command": "export-pg",
    "outputS3Path" : "s3://YOUR_TARGET_S3_BUCKET/neptune-export",
    "params": {
       "endpoint" : "YOUR_CLUSTER_ENDPOINT",
       "profile": "neptune_ml"
    }
  }'
We used only the required parameters here but you can easily extend the config. You can choose what part of the graph you export using the 'filter' parameter: you can select nodes, edges, and their properties.\
If you're exporting data from a live database, you can use the '' and '' parameters to make the neptue-export utility take a snapshot of the database, create a new Neptune cluster from that snapshot, deploy read replicas, and use them to export the data. By doing that, you can make sure the live database is not affected by the additional load from the data exporting.VIEWING EXPORTED DATA AND NEXT STEPSWhen the export process is completed, neptune-export prints some stats including the numbers of vertices and edges:Source:
  Nodes: 7126
  Edges: 70648
Export:
  Nodes: 7126
  Edges: 70648
  Properties: 28504
Details:
  Nodes: 
    user: 7126
        |_ days {propertyCount=7126, minCardinality=1, maxCardinality=1, recordCount=7126, dataTypeCounts=[Integer:7126]}
        |_ mature {propertyCount=7126, minCardinality=1, maxCardinality=1, recordCount=7126, dataTypeCounts=[Boolean:7126]}
        |_ views {propertyCount=7126, minCardinality=1, maxCardinality=1, recordCount=7126, dataTypeCounts=[Integer:7126]}
        |_ partner {propertyCount=7126, minCardinality=1, maxCardinality=1, recordCount=7126, dataTypeCounts=[Boolean:7126]}
  Edges: 
    (user)-follows-(user): 70648
And then it uploads the exported data to S3.\
Let's look at the files that are created in the target S3 bucket:\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
The ‘nodes’ and ‘edges’ directories contain CSV files with the lists of nodes and edges that are similar to what we used in Part 1 when we uploaded data. For large graphs, there are multiple files, but our dataset is small and there's just one file in each directory. There's also the training-data-configuration.json file that we'll edit and use in the next step of our process.\
If you're doing a one time export, now it's safe to delete the EC2 instance and the EBS volume, since only the files in the target S3 bucket will be used in the next step. Otherwise, you can just stop the EC2 instance to avoid getting charged for idle time (you'll still be charged for EBS storage unless you delete it).\
At this point we have the graph data in S3 in the format that can be used in the next step of the process, and we're ready to do feature encoding and data processing, which will be discussed in our next post.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>YouTube Surprise: CEO Says TV Overtakes Mobile as &apos;Primary Device&apos; for Viewing</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/02/11/1541222/youtube-surprise-ceo-says-tv-overtakes-mobile-as-primary-device-for-viewing?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:41:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If there was any doubt before, this seals it: YouTube is in the TV business.
