The king skirted the issue when asked by reporters after the meeting - saying it would be discussed with regional leaders. Trump repeated his claim that the 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza would voluntarily leave for Jordan and Egypt. He backed off earlier threats to withhold foreign aid from the longtime allies if they didn't accept his plan. Top U.N. human rights officials have said Trump's plan amounts to "ethnic cleansing." The forced displacement of Gazans would be considered a war crime under the Geneva Conventions.

Filion, an 18-year-old from Lancaster, Calif., was sentenced to four years in prison for making nearly 400 false bomb threats and threats of violence (source may be paywalled; alternative source) to religious institutions, schools, universities and homes across the country. The New York Times reports: The threatening calls Mr. Filion made would often cause large deployments of police officers to a targeted location, the Justice Department said in a news release. In some cases, officers would enter people's homes with their weapons drawn and detain those inside. In January 2023, Mr. Filion wrote on social media that his swats had often led the police to "drag the victim and their families out of the house cuff them and search the house for dead bodies."
 
Investigators linked Mr. Filion to over 375 swatting calls made in several states, including one that he made to the police in Sanford, Fla., saying that he would commit a mass shooting at the Masjid Al Hayy Mosque. During the call, he played audio of gunfire in the background. Mr. Filion was arrested in California in January 2024, and was then extradited to Florida to face state charges for making that threat. Mr. Filion began swatting for recreation in August 2022 before making it into a business, the Justice Department said. The teenager became a "serial swatter" and would make social media posts about his "swatting-for-a-fee" services, according to prosecutors.
 
In addition to pleading guilty to the false threat against the mosque in Florida, Mr. Filion pleaded guilty in three other swatting cases: a mass shooting threat to a public school in Washington State in October 2022; a bomb threat call to a historically Black college or university in Florida in May 2023; and a July 2023 call in which he claimed to be a federal law enforcement officer in Texas and told dispatchers that he had killed his mother and would kill any responding officers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DOGE Cuts, Trump&apos;s Gaza Plan | Balance of Power 02/11/25</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3f_WCZ8J7g</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/N3f_WCZ8J7g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:59:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Balance of Power" focuses on the intersection of politics and global business.

Now, the Automattic-owned blogging platform is sharing more information about when and how that integration could actually happen. As it turns out, the current plan to tie Tumblr into the open social web will come about by way of the site's planned move to the WordPress infrastructure. Automattic confirmed to TechCrunch that when the migration is complete, every Tumblr user will be able to federate their blog via ActivityPub, just as every WordPress.com user can today. The company noted that the migration could also allow for other open web integrations, like giving Tumblr users a way to run other custom plug-ins or themes.
 
Last summer, Automattic announced it would move its half a billion blogs to WordPress, to make it easier for the company to build tools and features that worked across both services, while also allowing Tumblr to take advantage of the open source developments from WordPress.org. Though the WordPress community itself is in a state of upheaval, ultimately running Tumblr's back end on WordPress would allow for greater efficiencies, while not changing the interface and experience that Tumblr's user base has grown to love. Automattic declined to share a time frame as to when the migration would be complete, given its scale, but a rep for the company called the progress so far "exciting." Automattic didn't say if it would consider integrating with the AT Protocol that powers Bluesky.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Kilauea volcano eruption in Hawaii</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gVPjIhTVu8</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/4gVPjIhTVu8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 23:34:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch live as the Kilauea volcano begins shooting lava into the air once again in Hawaii.

Tom's Hardware reports: We see the biggest drop in laptop CPU performance results. PassMark recorded an average result of 14,632 across 101,316 samples last year. But, in 2025, the average score sat at an average of 14,130 points between 25,541 samples, decreasing the average score by 3.4%. The average desktop PC result in 2024 netted 26,436 points for 186,053 samples. But for 2025, the average score currently sits at 26,311 points for over 47,810 samples -- a 0.5% drop from last year. While that drop is small, we should only see a continued progression of faster performance.
 
[...] Passmark itself mused on X (formerly Twitter) that it could be that people are switching to more affordable machines that deliver lower power and performance. Or maybe Windows 11 is depressing performance scores versus Windows 10, especially as people transition to it with the upcoming demise of the latter. We've certainly seen plenty of examples of reduced performance in gaming with some of the newer versions of Windows 11, particularly as Intel and AMD struggled to upstream needed updates into the OS. [...] PassMark also muses that bloatware could contribute to the sudden decline in performance, but that seems like a longshot.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mexico’s president reacts to Trump&apos;s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH91SOElHSM</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/RH91SOElHSM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 22:50:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Mexico’s Economy Secretary Marco Ebrard rejected Monday the new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, with the country's president saying countries in the region should 'stay together'.

Currently, it’s available only to Pro users in the U.S., but it’s coming globally soon. 🌍\
Cool, right? But hold up—are we sure websites won’t push back? 🤔 Will current anti-bot tech like IP bans, browser fingerprints, TLS fingerprints, and, of course, CAPTCHAs keep up with OpenAI’s new tool?\
So, who’s really winning in this battle between complex automated bots and anti-bot defenses? Read on to find out! 🔥LLM Models and Online Data: A Rocky RelationshipWhen LLM models first hit the market, it was nothing short of a revolution. The way we approach everyday tasks at work changed forever, the stock market reacted with excitement 🚀, and everyone jumped on the AI train (even if there wasn’t  AI behind most online products yet).\
So, where does all that data come from? Easy answer:  🌍\
The Web is the biggest source of data on the planet, so it’s no surprise companies like OpenAI scraped the Internet for years to collect the data needed to train their groundbreaking tech. And as long as web scraping is done ethically, there's nothing wrong with that 🤷.\
But here’s the catch: Most site owners aren’t thrilled about AI companies using their data! 😠\
In short, giving away your data for free is basically the same as handing out cash 💸. No wonder site owners—especially big companies—aren’t exactly thrilled about that. 😅\
Now that the landscape is evolving and new AI operators and tools are entering the scene, websites may start to get  unhappy about it. 😬AI Operators vs Websites: The Next Phase of This Troubled Relationship“Operator is powered by a new model called Computer-Using Agent (CUA). Combining GPT-4’s vision capabilities with advanced reasoning through reinforcement learning, CUA is trained to interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs)—the buttons, menus, and text fields people see on a screen.”\
It’s clear that, while AI companies like OpenAI have previously built scraping bots to gather data from popular sources to train their models, they’re now giving users a tool that can “magically” interact with and navigate websites. That’s both exciting and scary! 😱\
See OpenAI's Operator in action in the presentation video:\
Again, from the official presentation article:“Operator can “see” (through screenshots) and “interact” (using all the actions a mouse and keyboard allow) with a browser, enabling it to take action on the web without requiring custom API integrations.\
  If it encounters challenges or makes mistakes, Operator can leverage its reasoning capabilities to self-correct. When it gets stuck and needs assistance, it simply hands control back to the user, ensuring a smooth and collaborative experience.”\
That’s incredibly promising, but it also raises some serious concerns. 🤔 What if users start abusing Operator for malicious purposes? We’ve all had enough of bots (like those spammy comments flooding YouTube), and this could quickly spiral into a major problem. ⚠️\
Assuming OpenAI manages to prevent Operator from performing harmful or unwanted actions—just like they've worked to keep ChatGPT from answering dangerous questions—can we really be sure that most websites will welcome this kind of new, automated, AI-powered interaction? 🤖Before diving into the big question we left open, let’s first clarify what kind of interactions we’re dealing with. At the end of the day, if these new AI operators aren’t as effective as we think, why should we even bother protecting against them in the first place? 👀\
Currently, only U.S. users paying $200 a month for the highest subscription tier of ChatGPT Pro can access OpenAI’s Operator, so not everyone has had the chance to test it out. But for those who have? The results are impressive! 🤯\
Early users and tech reviewers found OpenAI’s amazing at automating everyday tasks like:Ordering food (yes, it can even automatically make decisions like choosing what restaurants to order from 🍔)Replying to users on some social media platformsCompleting small online tasks such as filling out surveys for rewards\
How is that possible? Operator opens a mini browser window and completes tasks based on your text prompts—just like a regular user would:\
Sure, the product is still in the “research preview” stage and isn’t perfect. Occasionally, you’ll need to give it a nudge or rescue it from a loop of failed attempts.\
➡️ The real question now: Will websites welcome AI-powered automation, or will they fight back? And if they do, how? ⚔️How Websites Are Fighting Back Against AIAnti-bot and anti-scraping solutions are nothing new—many sites have been using them for years to protect against automated scripts scraping data and interacting with their pages. 🚫\
If you’re curious about these methods, check out our webinar on advanced anti-bot techniques:: Tools that restrict the number of requests from a user in a given time to prevent overload. They work by banning IPs.: A method that tracks the unique characteristics of a browser’s encrypted connection to identify bots. Explore the role of TLS fingerprinting in web scraping.: A technique for detecting unique device or browser attributes to spot automated tools.These initial defenses focus on blocking requests from automated tools (like AI operators) before they even get a chance to access the site 🛡️.\
If those defenses fail, other techniques come into play. Some examples? CAPTCHAs are particularly effective because they’re designed to be easy for humans to solve, but tough for bots to crack.\
But with AI getting smarter and starting to think more like humans, recognizing bots is becoming harder. This is why some wild ideas, like using video games as CAPTCHAs, are being tossed around. 🎮\
But the real question is—are CAPTCHAs the ultimate solution against AI operators? Let’s dive in and find out! 💡Solving CAPTCHAs: Can AI Operators Really Beat the System?: Nope, not really… 🙅‍♂️\
Since OpenAI Operator hit the market for testing, users have been pushing it to complete tasks that involve CAPTCHAs—logging into social media, filling out forms, and more.“While it handles most steps automatically, CUA seeks user confirmation for sensitive actions, such as entering login details or responding to CAPTCHA forms.”\
Sure, sometimes the AI’s reasoning engine might sneak past a CAPTCHA 🥷, but more often than not, —with results that are both hilarious and frustrating. When put to the test on Reddit, Google Maps, Amazon, and G2, it repeatedly gets shut down by anti-bot protections.Watching AI operators crash and burn against CAPTCHAs has become a viral trend. Videos of these AI tools fumbling their way through login attempts are flooding Reddit and X:\
On one hand, this is reassuring—CAPTCHAs are doing their job and stopping automated bots from wreaking havoc. On the other hand, we’re in a cat-and-mouse game 🐁 🐈. Anti-bot tech and AI operators will keep evolving, taking turns being one step ahead.\
The real losers? Regular users! More sites will likely implement CAPTCHAs, making browsing more painful for everyone. And let’s be honest—we all hate CAPTCHAs. 😩\
This battle doesn’t just affect AI operators—ethical web scrapers are also getting caught in the crossfire. As sites ramp up anti-bot measures, legitimate scraping scripts will be unfairly blocked, making data extraction harder for researchers, businesses, and developers.\
Luckily, there’s a better way to interact with sites programmatically  dealing with CAPTCHAs and other anti-bot nightmares: Scraping Browser!The Real Winner? Bright Data’s Scraping Browser!OpenAI Operator automates regular browsers just like other browser automation tools. But here’s the thing—most anti-bot technologies, including CAPTCHAs, don’t appear  of the automation itself. They show up due to how the browser is configured!\
Most browser automation libraries set up browsers in ways that expose them as automated, completely defeating the purpose of using a “regular” browser. That’s where anti-bot systems step in and block access. 🚫\
Instead of focusing on whether AI can bypass CAPTCHAs, the real game-changer is using the right browser—one optimized for scraping and automation. That’s exactly where Bright Data’s Scraping Browser comes in, packed with:Reliable TLS fingerprints to avoid detection for large-scale data extraction powered by a 72-million IP proxy network to handle failed requestsCAPTCHA-solving superpowers that outperform AI operators 🧠\
Bright Data’s CAPTCHA solver has proven successful against:reCAPTCHA ✔️ (yep, the one OpenAI Operator couldn’t solve in the tweet above)\
Not only does it reduce the chances of CAPTCHAs appearing, but when they do show up, it . 🔥\
Scraping Browser works with all major browser automation frameworks—including Playwright, Puppeteer, and Selenium. So whether you want full programmatic control or even to add AI logic on top, you’re covered.\
See Bright Data’s Scraping Browser in action:\
So… should we keep forcing AI to solve CAPTCHAs, or just use a tool that works? The choice is obvious.  🏆OpenAI’s Operator is here to revolutionize web interaction—but it’s not all-powerful. While impressive, it still struggles against CAPTCHAs and gets blocked.\
Avoid the hassle with Scraping Browser, featuring a built-in CAPTCHA Solver for seamless automation. Embark on our quest to democratize the Web, ensuring it remains accessible for all, everywhere, even through automated scripts!\
Until next time, keep exploring the Internet freely and without CAPTCHAs!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>USAID can’t track $8.2 billion in unspent aid | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqN6e5YXWzg</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eqN6e5YXWzg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 22:23:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Regulators at the U.S. Agency for International Development say the organization can no longer track billions of dollars in unspent humanitarian aid. They say President Trump's rapid dismantling of USAID means it can no longer ensure that 8.2 billion in funds don't fall into the hands of extremist groups or get lost in unstable regions or conflict zones around the world. 
Hundreds of USAID programs, covering billions of dollars in assistance, came to an abrupt halt after Trump ordered a freeze on most foreign aid. His administration has moved to dismantle the agency and possibly merge it with the State Department. This has left not only billions of dollars in limbo, but also hundreds of employees.

The sanctions target Zservers, its UK front company XHOST Internet Solutions, and six individuals linked to its operations. The Register reports: Headquartered in Barnaul, Russia, Zservers provided BPH services to a number of LockBit affiliates, the three nations said today. On numerous occasions, affiliates purchased servers from the company to support ransomware attacks. The trio said the link between Zservers and LockBit was established as early as 2022, when Canadian law enforcement searched a known LockBit affiliate and found evidence they had purchased infrastructure tooling almost certainly used to host chatrooms with ransomware victims.
 
"Ransomware actors and other cybercriminals rely on third-party network service providers like Zservers to enable their attacks on US and international critical infrastructure," said Bradley T Smith, acting under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence. "Today's trilateral action with Australia and the United Kingdom underscores our collective resolve to disrupt all aspects of this criminal ecosystem, wherever located, to protect our national security." The UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) said additionally that the UK front company for Zservers, XHOST Internet Solutions, was also included in its sanctions list. According to Companies House, the UK arm was incorporated on January 31, 2022, although the original service was established in 2011 and operated in both Russia and the Netherlands. Anyone found to have business dealings with either entity can face criminal and civil charges under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018.
 
The UK led the way with sanctions, placing six individuals and the two entities on its list, while the US only placed two of the individuals -- both alleged Zservers admins -- on its equivalent. Alexander Igorevich Mishin and Aleksandr Sergeyevich Bolshakov, both 30 years old, were named by the US as the operation's heads. Mishin was said to have marketed Zservers to LockBit and other ransomware groups, managing the associated cryptocurrency transactions. Both he and Bolshakov responded to a complaint from a Lebanese company in 2023 and shut down an IP address used in a LockBit attack. The US said, however, it was possible that the pair set up a replacement IP address that LockBit could carry on using, while telling the Lebanese company that they complied with its request. The UK further sanctioned Ilya Vladimirovich Sidorov, Dmitry Konstantinovich Bolshakov (no mention of whether he is any relation to Aleksandr), Igor Vladimirovich Odintsov, and Vladimir Vladimirovich Ananev. Other than that they were Zservers employees and thus were directly or indirectly involved in attempting to inflict economic loss to the country, not much was said about either of their roles.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New hack uses prompt injection to corrupt Gemini’s long-term memory</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/new-hack-uses-prompt-injection-to-corrupt-geminis-long-term-memory/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gemini_header-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 22:13:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the nascent field of AI hacking, indirect prompt injection has become a basic building block for inducing chatbots to exfiltrate sensitive data or perform other malicious actions. Developers of platforms such as Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT are generally good at plugging these security holes, but hackers keep finding new ways to poke through them again and again.On Monday, researcher Johann Rehberger demonstrated a new way to override prompt injection defenses Google developers have built into Gemini—specifically, defenses that restrict the invocation of Google Workspace or other sensitive tools when processing untrusted data, such as incoming emails or shared documents. The result of Rehberger’s attack is the permanent planting of long-term memories that will be present in all future sessions, opening the potential for the chatbot to act on false information or instructions in perpetuity.More about the attack later. For now, here is a brief review of indirect prompt injections: Prompts in the context of large language models (LLMs) are instructions, provided either by the chatbot developers or by the person using the chatbot, to perform tasks, such as summarizing an email or drafting a reply. But what if this content contains a malicious instruction? It turns out that chatbots are so eager to follow instructions that they often take their orders from such content, even though there was never an intention for it to act as a prompt.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: House Financial Services Subcommittee hearing on digital assets and AI</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJU0RDTKKAA</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/XJU0RDTKKAA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 22:13:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Live hearing by the United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on digital assets, financial technology and artificial intelligence.

In 2020, the media and technology conglomerate filed an unprecedentedAI copyright lawsuit against the legal AI startup Ross Intelligence. In the complaint, Thomson Reuters claimed the AI firm reproduced materials from its legal research firm Westlaw. Today, a judge ruled (PDF) in Thomson Reuters' favor, finding that the company's copyright was indeed infringed by Ross Intelligence's actions. "None of Ross's possible defenses holds water. I reject them all," wrote US District Court of Delaware judge Stephanos Bibas, in a summary judgement. [...] Notably, Judge Bibas ruled in Thomson Reuters' favor on the question of fair use.
 
The fair use doctrine is a key component of how AI companies are seeking to defend themselves against claims that they used copyrighted materials illegally. The idea underpinning fair use is that sometimes it's legally permissible to use copyrighted works without permission -- for example, to create parody works, or in noncommercial research or news production. When determining whether fair use applies, courts use a four-factor test, looking at the reason behind the work, the nature of the work (whether it's poetry, nonfiction, private letters, et cetera), the amount of copyrighted work used, and how the use impacts the market value of the original. Thomson Reuters prevailed on two of the four factors, but Bibas described the fourth as the most important, and ruled that Ross "meant to compete with Westlaw by developing a market substitute." "If this decision is followed elsewhere, it's really bad for the generative AI companies," says James Grimmelmann, Cornell University professor of digital and internet law. 
Chris Mammen, a partner at Womble Bond Dickinson who focuses on intellectual property law, adds: "It puts a finger on the scale towards holding that fair use doesn't apply."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Eagles deny Chiefs historic three-peat in Super Bowl win | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKVMNX2-xUc</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MKVMNX2-xUc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 21:37:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Philadelphia Eagles obliterated the Kansas City Chiefs’ bid to become the first NFL team to win three consecutive Super Bowls with a blowout 40-22 win.

But have you ever wondered where they get all that information?The forecasts can seem effortless, but behind the scenes, a vast network of satellites, airplanes, radar, computer models and weather analysts are providing access to the latest data – and warnings when necessary. This data comes from analysts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, known as NOAA, and its National Weather Service.Atmospheric scientists Christine Wiedinmyer and Kari Bowen, who is a former National Weather Service forecaster, explained NOAA’s central role in most U.S. weather forecasts.When people see a weather report on TV, what went on at NOAA to make that forecast possible?All of that information goes into the agency’s computers, which process the data to begin defining what’s going on in different parts of the atmosphere. NOAA forecasters use computer models that simulate physics and the behavior of the atmosphere, along with their own experience and local knowledge, to start to paint a picture of the weather – what’s coming in a few minutes or hours or days. They also use that data to project seasonal conditions out over weeks or months.All of this analysis happens before the information reaches private weather apps and TV stations.No matter who you are, you can freely access that data and the analyses. In fact, a large number of private companies use NOAA data to create fancy maps and other weather products that they sell.It would be extremely difficult to do all of that without NOAA.The agency operates a fleet of 18 satellites that are packed with instruments dedicated to observing weather phenomena essential to predicting the weather, from how hot the land surface is to the water content of the atmosphere. Some are geostationary satellites which sit high above different parts of the U.S. measuring weather conditions 24/7. Others orbit the planet. Many of these are operated as part of partnerships with NASA or the Air Force.Some private companies are starting to invest in satellites, but it would take an enormous amount of money to replicate the range of instrumentation and coverage that NOAA has in place. Satellites only last so long and take time to build, so NOAA is continually planning for the future, and using its technical expertise to develop new instruments and computer algorithms to interpret the data.Maritime buoys are another measuring system that would be difficult to replicate. Over 1,300 buoys across oceans around the world measure water temperature, wind and wave height – all of which are essential for coastal warnings, as well as long-term forecasts.Weather observation has been around a long time. President Ulysses S. Grant created the first national weather service in the War Department in 1870. It became a civilian service in 1880 under the Department of Agriculture and is now in the Commerce Department. The information its scientists and technologists produce is essential for safety and also benefits people and industries in a lot of ways. Could a private company create forecasts on its own without NOAA data?It would be difficult for one company to provide comprehensive weather data in a reliable way that is also accessible to the entire public.Some companies might be able to launch their own satellite, but one satellite only gives you part of the picture. NOAA’s weather observation network has been around for a long time and collects data from points all over the U.S. and the oceans. Without that robust data, computer models and the broad network of forecasters and developers, forecasting also becomes less reliable.Analyzing that data is also complex. You’re not going to be able to take satellite data, run a model on a standard laptop and suddenly have a forecast. And there’s a question of whether a private company would want to take on the legal risk of being responsible for the nation’s forecasts and severe weather warnings. NOAA is taxpayer-funded, so it is a public good – its services provide safety and security for everyone, not just those who can pay for it.If weather data was only available at a price, one town might be able to afford the weather information necessary to protect its residents, while a smaller town or a rural area across the state might not. If you’re in a tornado-prone area or coastal zone, that information can be the difference between life or death.Is climate data and research into the changing climate important for forecasts?The Earth’s systems – its land, water and the atmosphere – are changing, and we have to be able to assess how those changes will impact weather tomorrow, in two weeks and far into the future.Rising global temperatures affect weather patterns. Dryness can fuel wildfires. Forecasts have to take the changing climate into account to be accurate, no matter who is creating the forecast.Drought is an example. The dryness of the Earth controls how much water gets exchanged with the atmosphere to form clouds and rainfall. To have an accurate weather prediction, we need to know how dry things are at the surface and how that has changed over time. That requires long-term climate information.NOAA doesn’t do all of this by itself – who else is involved?NOAA partners with private sector, academia, nonprofits and many others around the world to ensure that everyone has the best information to produce the most robust weather forecasts. Private weather companies and media also play important roles in getting those forecasts and alerts out more widely to the public.A lot of businesses rely on accuracy from NOAA’s weather data and forecasts: aviation, energy companies, insurance, even modern tractors’ precision farming equipment. The agency’s long-range forecasts are essential for managing state reservoirs to ensure enough water is saved and to avoid flooding.The government agency can be held accountable in a way private businesses are not because it answers to Congress. So, the data is trustworthy, accessible and developed with the goal to protect public safety and property for everyone. Could the same be said if only for-profit companies were producing that data?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>S&amp;P 500 Closes Near Flat | Closing Bell</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbxq6bdoLoc</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Vbxq6bdoLoc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 21:28:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the U.S. market close on Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio, and YouTube with Alix Steel, Scarlet Fu, Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec.

A WYSIWYG editor provides editing capabilities similar to those of Microsoft Word.Event calendars enable synchronization with Outlook and Google calendars and provide responsive layout, localization, built-in view modes, and more.Online documentation is comprehensive.Some of the components can require more time and effort to customize.Components appear to be wrapped versions of their JavaScript controls, which may require you to learn more JavaScript to configure them.Managing licenses is not always a seamless process; a new license key is needed every time you update Syncfusion in an application.The online documentation is rather extensive but can be lacking.Syncfusion provides a valuable toolbox for designing and developing modern .NET applications in Blazor. Its data visualization tools make it easy to present large and complex datasets.\
While the online documentation may be insufficient, especially for specialized queries, you will likely find what you need in blogs, forums, knowledge base, and support.With more than 70 native Blazor components, the DevExpress Blazor UI library can help you speed up the development process. Its most recent release included several Blazor enhancements, including the integration of AI.Key Features and CapabilitiesA Data Grid component can easily handle large datasets and bind to remote data.You can use data editors alone or edit cell values to group items, making lists more readable.Document processing includes exporting to PDF, XLS, XLSX, RTF, DOCX, MHT, HTML, TXT, CSV, and image formats.Cross-platform capabilities enable the development of Blazor Hybrid hosting models.AI-supported chat, HTML, and RTF editor extensions are available.Online documentation and tutorials are comprehensive.With just over 20 types of charts, data visualization options may be more limited compared with other libraries.Certain functionalities are not inherent in the controls; in some cases, you may have to add some functions manually.While the number of components may be less than some other libraries on this list, DevExpress still has a full suite of flexible Blazor UI components that can simplify the development process. The Data Grid component, in particular, can save development time. It includes all the typical functionalities for a modern web application, even if the options, such as chart selection, may not be as expansive as others.Radzen Blazor components are a free, open-source option for .NET developers. There are more than 90 native Blazor components. Radzen also provides paid plans, including one that provides a low-code option and another that provides access to premium features.Key Features and CapabilitiesThe Radzen Blazor for Visual Studio extension integrates components directly into the familiar Visual Studio 2022 to connect to data, design, seamlessly code, and work faster.Data visualization capabilities include charts, gauges, GoogleMaps, sparkline, timeline, and an SSRS viewer (which displays a report created in SQL Server Reporting Services).Customize navigation with options like accordion, carousel, context menu, links, and more.Shape the UI by specifying themes, colors, borders, and other attributes.The Pro plan includes UI blocks, cards, calls-to-actions, features, footers, and page headings.You can customize forms using the autocomplete, listbox, button, and color picker components, among others. Limited reporting and documentation capabilities (SSRS).A limited number of chart types and data visualizations compared to the paid-for offerings.Most of the examples provided seem to focus on the free components.The current templates provide basic, useful features but require extensive customization to make them useful for applications.Radzen’s Blazor component library is a relatively young product compared to the other libraries on this list. Its inadequate documentation is a weakness. The sample offering could also be improved by including examples in the paid plans. Still, it is a powerful tool that will help developers save time.There are many similarities among the libraries included in this list. For example, they all support .NET 9.0. However, when you consider that you must constantly weigh a project’s requirements against the effectiveness of the Blazor component library, ComponentOne from MESCIUS stands out as the top choice.\
ComponentOne has extensive components that provide the ultimate developer experience for a reasonable, low price. Ease-of-use and customization are both focus points of the library. It makes efficient use of code by enabling migration to other platforms. Components like the FlexGrid control can easily and quickly handle massive datasets. There is a wide selection of highly customizable charts for data visualizations to create tailored dashboards that suit the application's needs. Additional capabilities, like reporting, documentation, input editors, and much more, ensure you can create high-quality web applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft powers AI ambitions with 400 MW solar purchase</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/microsoft-powers-ai-ambitions-with-400-mw-solar-purchase/</link><author>Tim De Chant</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 21:11:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft has added another 389 megawatts of renewable power to its portfolio as the tech giant scrambles to meet the power demands required to match its AI ambitions.  The additional renewable power spans three solar projects developed by EDP Renewables North America — two in southern Illinois and one outside Austin, Texas.

In the complaint, Thomson Reuters claimed the AI firm reproduced materials from its legal research firm Westlaw. Today, a judge ruled in Thomson Reuters’ favor, finding that the company’s copyright was indeed infringed by Ross Intelligence’s actions.“None of Ross’s possible defenses holds water. I reject them all,” wrote US District Court of Delaware judge Stephanos Bibas, in a summary judgement.Thomson Reuters and Ross Intelligence did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The generative AI boom has led to a spate of additional legal fights about how AI companies can use copyrighted material, as many major AI tools were developed by training on copyrighted works including books, films, visual artwork, and websites. Right now, there are several dozen lawsuits currently winding through the US court system, as well as international challenges in China, Canada, the UK, and other countries.Notably, Judge Bibas ruled in Thomson Reuters’ favor on the question of fair use. The fair use doctrine is a key component of how AI companies are seeking to defend themselves against claims that they used copyrighted materials illegally. The idea underpinning fair use is that sometimes it’s legally permissible to use copyrighted works without permission—for example, to create parody works, or in noncommercial research or news production. When determining whether fair use applies, courts use a four-factor test, looking at the reason behind the work, the nature of the work (whether it’s poetry, nonfiction, private letters, et cetera), the amount of copyrighted work used, and how the use impacts the market value of the original. Thomson Reuters prevailed on two of the four factors, but Bibas described the fourth as the most important, and ruled that Ross “meant to compete with Westlaw by developing a market substitute.”Thomson Reuters spokesperson Jeffrey McCoy applauded the ruling in a statement emailed to WIRED. “We are pleased that the court granted summary judgment in our favor and concluded that Westlaw’s editorial content created and maintained by our attorney editors, is protected by copyright and cannot be used without our consent,” he wrote. “The copying of our content was not ‘fair use.’”Even before this ruling, Ross Intelligence had already felt the impact of the court battle: The startup shut down in 2021, citing the cost of litigation. In contrast, many of the AI companies still duking it out in court, like OpenAI and Google, are financially equipped to weather prolonged legal fights.Still, this ruling is a blow to AI companies, according to Cornell University professor of digital and internet law James Grimmelmann: “If this decision is followed elsewhere, it's really bad for the generative AI companies.” Grimmelmann believes that Bibas’ judgement suggests that much of the case law that generative AI companies are citing to argue fair use is “irrelevant.”Chris Mammen, a partner at Womble Bond Dickinson who focuses on intellectual property law, concurs that this will complicate AI companies’ fair use arguments, although it could vary from plaintiff to plaintiff. “It puts a finger on the scale towards holding that fair use doesn’t apply,” he says.Update 2/11/25 5:09 ET: This story has been updated to include additional comment from Thomson Reuters.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anduril To Take Over Managing Microsoft Goggles for US Army</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/11/2011222/anduril-to-take-over-managing-microsoft-goggles-for-us-army?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 20:55:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Anduril will take over management and eventual manufacturing of the U.S. Army's Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) from Microsoft, a significant shift in one of the military's most ambitious augmented reality projects. 

The deal, which requires Army approval, could be worth over $20 billion in the next decade if all options are exercised, according to Bloomberg. The IVAS system, based on Microsoft's HoloLens mixed reality platform, aims to equip soldiers with advanced capabilities including night vision and airborne threat detection. 

Under the new arrangement, Microsoft will transition to providing cloud computing and AI infrastructure, while Anduril assumes control of hardware production and software development. The Army has planned orders for up to 121,000 units, though full production hinges on passing combat testing this year. 

The program has faced technical hurdles, with early prototypes causing headaches and nausea among soldiers. The current slimmer version has received better feedback, though cost remains a concern - the Army indicated the $80,000 per-unit price needs to "be substantially less" to justify large-scale procurement. 

Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, writing in a blog post: This move has been so many years in the making, over a decade of hacking and scheming and dreaming and building with exactly this specific outcome clearly visualized in my mind's eye. I can hardly believe I managed to pull it off. Everything I've done in my career -- building Oculus out of a camper trailer, shipping VR to millions of consumers, getting run out of Silicon Valley by backstabbing snakes, betting that Anduril could tear people out of the bigtech megacorp matrix and put them to work on our nation's most important problems -- has led to this moment. IVAS isn't just another product, it is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine how technology supports those who serve. We have a shot to prove that this long-standing dream is no windmill, that this can expand far beyond one company or one headset and act as a a nexus for the best of the best to set a new standard for how a large collection of companies can work together to solve our nation's most important problems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia could start a major war in Europe within 5 years, Danish intelligence warns</title><link>https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-war-threat-europe-within-5-years-danish-intelligence-ddis-warns/</link><author>/u/hashing_nonces</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 20:49:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tech billionaire continues to attract vitriol after his controversial salute at Donald Trump’s inauguration party. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump says the US is &apos;going to have Gaza&apos;</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCVzFSKqvWo</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eCVzFSKqvWo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 20:44:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Donald Trump hosted Jordan’s King Abdullah II at the White House Tuesday and renewed his insistence that he has "U.S. authority" to take over Gaza.

Crypto was born to disrupt the financial world, and it has, albeit not in the way Satoshi Nakamoto intended. In becoming so much more, it grew into a massive playground for speculation. Traders weren’t satisfied with spot trading and turned their eyes to derivatives like futures and options.\
In this article, we break down options—how they differ from futures and the evolution of perpetual options on centralised and decentralised exchanges. We also examine flaws and challenges and speculate on what the future holds. Sit tight, and let’s dive in!A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy/sell a certain asset (the underlying) at a given time in the future. At first, futures were invented to hedge risks associated with commodities like soy, crude oil, or gold. A seller can set a price before they can deliver the underlying and let the buyer assume some of the risks. Since you don't get the underlying when you sign the contract, you don't have to pay the full price. Instead, a deposit equal to a portion of your position's value is all you need to keep this contract valid. Therefore, you can sign a futures contract worth $100 with only $10 and if the price goes up by 10% to $110, you will get a 100% profit ($10). Such is the power of leverage and is ideal for crypto investors seeking to amplify their returns.\
Eventually, someone realized you don't have to deliver the product at a given time because cryptocurrencies will always be there. A futures contract that never expires looks tempting to anyone seeking 100X their investments.\
There is one caveat, though. Since Satoshi Nakamoto released his famous whitepaper, the overwhelming majority of the crypto community has been longing cryptocurrencies. As a consequence, the futures market will be dominated by buyers, moving the futures price ridiculously higher than its spot price.\
Traditional futures contracts also have this problem but the market has a way to manage it. These contracts expire, so any deviation between the futures price and the spot price gradually disappears as the expiry date approaches.It happens because the difference between buying on the futures market and the spot market becomes smaller over time.\
The same can not be said for perpetual futures. Now that they don't expire, we may never see the day when the basis disappears. Something must be done.\
For the record, we don't know what happened when BitMEX invented perpetual futures but since these contracts are sometimes referred to as perpetual swaps, one can only assume that they decided to borrow a mechanism from swap contracts - an agreement between two parties to exchange cash flow, typically used to hedge the risk of oscillating loan interest rates or to exchange value between two positions.\
With this mechanism, perpetual futures buyers and sellers must exchange cash flow (making 'funding payments') with each other based on the difference between the underlying's futures price and spot price. If the futures price is higher (the underlying trading at a premium), the buyers have outbought the sellers. At such times, the funding rate mechanism dictates buyers must pay sellers based on their position size. This way, sellers will have enough reason to hold on to their short positions and buyers will have their accounts bled dry if they keep their long positions open indefinitely.The reason we spent hundreds of words talking about perpetual futures in an article dedicated to options is that we wish to demonstrate how removing a seemingly insignificant variable (expiry date) from a financial instrument could lead to starking imbalances in the market and take some of the most innovative minds to fix it by introducing a new mechanism.Options are quite like futures, except futures contracts impose on both parties the obligation to transact a certain asset at a given time, whereas options only give them the right. You have the option to pocket your profit when your option is in the money (ITM), as well as throw it into the bin when it's out of the money (OTM).\
As such, futures contracts can be priced based on their entry price but options must charge a premium for signing this contract. This premium is the price a buyer pays a seller (writer) and options at each price tick form a market on their own. Buyers are free to choose the lowest ask they can find for a certain underlying at a certain strike price. Once again, removing one restraint (obligation to buy or sell) from a financial instrument leads to an entirely different derivative.\
Traditional options already give investors immense flexibility for locking profits and hedging risks. You can hold a long position for an underlying while buying a put option of the same size for the same underlying at the same price. This way, if the price goes down, your long position is at a loss but the amount is only equal to your profit from the put option (or its seller), leaving you losing only the premium you paid for your put. If the price goes up, your long position stands to profit and you can throw your OTM put option in the bin.\
As you have seen, even options that expire are already much more complex than futures. Black, Scholes, and Merton won a Nobel Prize for developing a formula for stock options valuation. But what if we take it a step further and remove the expiry date from the options, like what we did to futures?There are two approaches that have our attention. One was proposed by Paradigm and the notorious Sam Bankman-Fried in their research titled 'Everlasting Options', and the other by Panoptic.Everlasting options: A universal funding model for efficient liquidity and arbitrageIn this paper, the authors proposed a universal funding mechanism for derivatives based on the difference between mark price and index price of the underlying (for futures) or the contract itself (for options). This is a generalised version of the perpetual futures funding mechanism and backed by the no-arbitrage pricing model that where there is a potential profit, there will be arbitrageurs to make the most of it. In the case of perpetual futures, buyers will pay sellers when the mark price is higher than the spot price or in the case of everlasting options, when the mark price is higher than the potential payoff.\
This universal mechanism is playing the arbitrageuers and such activities are ideal for centralized exchanges since the calculations and payments can be made within milliseconds by their complex trading engine running on mega servers. Indeed, the authors mentioned the traditional crypto options market being a nightmare (in our own words) for market makers because there are just so many markets to make. Their everlasting options are equivalent to a basket of options with different expiration times and weights equal to the inverse of 2 to the power of the number of funding cycles before the expiration time. This way, market makers can concentrate their liquidity on these baskets instead of spreading it on 100 markets.\
But the thing is, no one said options can only be traded on centralized exchanges with large institutions as market makers/liquidity providers. A decentralised ecosystem calls for decentralised protocols, and mechanisms that are less costly and cumbersome for smart contracts.Panoptions: A Uniswap-inspired, oracle-free revolutionEnter Panoptic with their perpetual options ('Panoptions'). By comparing a put option to a Uniswap V3 liquidity pool, they proposed this on-chain option that never expires.\
Uniswap V3 pools allow liquidity providers to deposit 2 assets and earn fees when the price ratio between these 2 assets is within a certain range. When it's out of the range, your liquidity becomes 100% of the asset with the lower price. Panoptic put options are essentially concentrated liquidity deployed on a single price point - its strike price. Let's pretend you hold an ETH-USDT Panoptic put option. When ETH's price goes above the strike price, this put option is OTM and becomes 100% USDT. When ETH's price is below the strike price, the buyer can give 1 ETH to the seller in exchange for all the USDT in the pool, earning the difference between the strike price and the price they paid for that 1 ETH.\
Panoptic call options work exactly the same except the 2 assets must switch places.\
But that's only half the formula. We still need to price the Panoptions by putting a premium on them. In contrast to traditional options, Panoptions charge no premium upfront and assume that the value of options can be realised over time.\
Meet θ, a Greek letter used to define the rate of an option's value decline over time. If you studied derivatives (the mathematical one), you would know the derivative of mileage over time is velocity - the rate/speed of your mileage increase over time. And by integrating the speed over time, you get mileage. Theoretically, the same goes for options: if we integrate θ, the 'value speed', over time, we get value.We are able to do this because there is another formula for θ instead of doing derivatives:\
Where S denotes the underlying asset spot (or current) price, σ is the asset’s volatility, K is the strike price, and t is the time to expiration.\
Note this formula is flawed since we assumed a 0 risk-free interest rate when in reality it can get quite higher. But how high? Should we take the interest rate from Binance Earn, ETH staking, Aave Lend, or heaven forbid, treasury bonds? This question may take an industry to answer.\
The good news is, we still haven't said a word about oracles because by tethering Panoptions to the corresponding Uniswap V3 pool, this system won't ever need an oracle as long as there are enough traders swapping tokens via this pool.\
This way, we have a simulated option on smart contracts, a premium that is price path dependent but oracle-free, and some solid knowledge in derivatives, both financial and mathematical. We are probably more ready than 99.9% of individuals on earth to trade options.Perpetual options on-chainPanoptic built an entire options trading ecosystem with smart contracts. Participants are divided into liquidity providers, option sellers, and option buyers.\
Before anyone can do anything, liquidity providers must first deposit assets into a liquidity pool. Sellers and buyers must also deposit their collateral. Sellers need to first mint their call or put option by paying a 0.1% commission and locking up (borrowing) a certain amount of liquidity at a strike price. Then, buyers can buy these options by paying the same rate of commission, locking up some more liquidity, and minting their position.\
Since our premium is accumulated over time, there should be 0 premium when the option was just sold. Instead, sellers would be credited a streaming premium every time the spot price crosses the strike price.\
When exercising their options, buyers will pay back their borrowed liquidity plus premium while getting the numeraire (for put options) or the underlying asset (for call options).\
On one hand, Panoptions is genius. By synthesising options with Uniswap V3 pools and settling premium when the option is exercised, the entire process is moved onto the blockchain. Anyone can access these financial instruments as long as they know their way around wallets and smart contracts. Under the ERC-1155 token standard, you can mint several options into one token for further risk and volatility customisation or even duplicate a composition someone else just shared.\
On the other hand, since Panoptions can be minted at 0 premium and a 0.1% fee, who's to stop arbitrageurs from buying ITM options before immediately exercising them for guaranteed profit? After a few costly lessons, who's to encourage sellers into minting ITM positions only to lose money? With only OTM options, the market will be as bustling as an empty bucket.Finding the f(law) in funding & financeThat's not to say the centralised approach has no flaw. The universal funding mechanism can be perfect if the funding is calculated and implemented every nanosecond. But when the funding cycle is stretched to 8 hours, a lot of things can happen right before and after funding payments are made. People may open a position 0.01 seconds before funding and close it immediately after receiving funding payments, leading to abnormal fluctuations around the time of funding.\
If we take a step back, the funding mechanism is merely a bandaid slapped onto someone with a headache that is CEX-traded crypto options. The real hurdle that is holding so many exchanges back from introducing options is the lack of liquidity.\
When you first look at it, crypto options seem a good instrument boasting similar open interest to perpetual futures:\
When in reality, the options market is divided into hundreds of sub-markets, each with a different expiration, strike price, and supply & demand. As a result, liquidity is fragmented into dozens of pieces and the spread on some sub-markets can be jaw-dropping. And that's just Bitcoin. Go to Bybit, the 2nd/3rd CEX, and look for options for Solana, the 4th largest crypto (not counting stablecoins) looking to surpass Ether, you'll find almost half of the sub-markets empty. Options are just too complex for investors without a systematic understanding of finance and investing, at least at first glance. It's not even friendly to market makers, as mentioned in Path dependency.\
Looks like we must educate all traders about the benefits of options and invite them to trade these fine instruments. Markets can be made as long as there are enough traders. But that's just another bandaid on an even grimmer headache.\
If you're looking to trade crypto derivatives, there are 2 places to go: CEX and DEX. CEXs are generally faster with more liquidity but you must go through an arduous KYC process and put your funds in the hands of others. DEXs give you more control and freedom but are not nearly as fast or efficient as CEXs. At its current state, blockchain will never be an ideal place for sophisticated or institutional traders commanding huge liquidity who would choose speed over decentralisation and permissionlessness any day. Many DEXs will look to centralise 1 or several links in their protocol such as order book, order matching engine, database, market makers and more to maximize efficiency and attract large institutions with deep pockets. As a result, centralised institutions will have more and more say in these protocols and in the end, they may just turn into on-chain CEXs where decentralisation is nothing but a name.\
Such is the finance industry. When even the slightest edge may put you ahead and rake in billions of dollars, the survivors will look to build higher and higher walls and work with players from all walks to protect their interests. To a newcomer, the world of finance is as much a dark forest as Ethereum is although neither was designed to be initially. Uninitiated individuals will always get eaten alive in such a hostile environment while the survivors feed on their remains and grow into behemoths that are too big to fall. In the end, these financial giants will have immense fun playing with sophisticated, quadruple synthesised products like MBS in an extremely centralised walled garden while the outsiders will do anything for an entry pass.\
Satoshi Nakamoto did invent Bitcoin to battle centralisation but now, the cryptocurrencies may just become another place where institutions take in individuals' funds and throw them one or two bones every now and then.But the future is not all doom and gloom. There surely will be more brilliant minds trying to innovate on perpetual options and evangelising this financial instrument. Options that favour long-term investors with minimal arbitraging opportunities may be invented and blockchain is just an ideal place for them. Account abstraction may eventually bring in hundreds of millions of new users and with them, fragmented liquidity may not be a problem any more. Traders who value decentralisation and privacy will still get to play and grow their own games. A few boutique protocols may survive through the years and eventually be discovered by the masses.\
Looking back, perpetual options may not even be the right answer we are looking for. They are one of the most important derivatives with a spark of crypto innovation but at its current state, it's merely a derivation from a traditional financial instrument that is as far from decentralisation as an empty bucket. To disrupt the old finance, we may need to build a new one from the ground up.A version of this article was originally published .]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Answering Questions About Why the Big Bang Happened, The Shape of the Universe &amp; More</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEoL0PNaIK4</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/QEoL0PNaIK4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 20:23:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Could slowing time increase mass? Do particles ever collide or do they just get really really close? Did anything go “bang” during the Big Bang? Neil deGrasse Tyson, co-host Paul Mecurio, and astrophysicist Charles Liu tackle these cosmic questions and more!

Shouldn’t the vacuum of space cause interstellar gas clouds to disperse evenly? We break down how diffusion works and how different forces come together to keep gas clouds intact. What’s in these clouds, and why does some gas get left behind during star formation? Next, we confront the Big Bang itself: what exactly went “bang”? We dive into the misconceptions surrounding the term and its origins with Fred Hoyle. 

What can we learn from gravitational waves beyond just detecting them? We explore the structure of spacetime and the speed of gravity. How do gravitational waves offer a deeper understanding of the universe’s invisible framework? Could slowing down time increase mass? We discuss the manipulation of time and the nature of scientific inquiry. 

As the discussion turns to cosmic collisions, we explore how galaxies interact without stars ever touching. Do particles ever collide or do they just get really really close? What forces govern these interactions, and how do fields and forces influence the behavior of matter? Charles reveals the almost magical dynamics of gravitational and electromagnetic forces, while Neil ties it back to Newton and Einstein.

Finally, we look back in time to the earliest generations of stars. How do we study stars that existed billions of years ago, and what did these stellar giants sacrifice to forge the elements of life? Charles delivers a heartfelt tribute to these cosmic ancestors, reminding us how the light of the past illuminates our understanding of the universe today.

From a report: Google's preliminary copy suggests it's an "AI innovation," though exactly how is unclear. 

Noted software digger Leopeva64 on X found a new offering in the AI settings of a very early build of Chrome. The option, "Automated password Change" (so, early stages -- as to not yet get a copyedit), is described as, "When Chrome finds one of your passwords in a data breach, it can offer to change your password for you when you sign in." 

Chrome already has a feature that warns users if the passwords they enter have been identified in a breach and will prompt them to change it. As noted by Windows Report, the change is that now Google will offer to change it for you on the spot rather than simply prompting you to handle that elsewhere. The password is automatically saved in Google's Password Manager and "is encrypted and never seen by anyone," the settings page claims.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Luis Rubiales tells judge that Jenni Hermoso gave him consent for kiss after Women&apos;s World Cup</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtoMJD_D38c</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mtoMJD_D38c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 20:14:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rubiales is accused of sexual assault and coercion for allegedly trying to downplay the kiss that sparked outrage in Spain, and marred the celebrations of the team's first World Cup title.

In line with what many enthusiasts might expect, the PassMark graph has always shown a consistent increase in processor performance year-on-year. However, for the first time since the company started keeping track in 2004, the average CPU mark score for desktop and laptop processors has dropped, with laptops dropping 3.4% year-over-year.We see the biggest drop in laptop CPU performance results. PassMark recorded an average result of 14,632 across 101,316 samples last year. But, in 2025, the average score sat at an average of 14,130 points between 25,541 samples, decreasing the average score by 3.4%.The average desktop PC result in 2024 netted 26,436 points for 186,053 samples. But for 2025, the average score currently sits at 26,311 points for over 47,810 samples — a 0.5% drop from last year. While that drop is small, we should only see a continued progression of faster performance.We’ve also seen results for the top-performing CPUs, and it seems that we’ve basically reached a performance plateau, will little to no uplift in PassMark scores for the past three years for desktop chips and laptop CPUs. This happened after we received a massive uplift of 58.6% in the Top Desktop CPU benchmark scores in 2023, with the introduction of the AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 7995WX. The arrival of the AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX3D laptop CPU in the same year also delivered a 69.9% jump in average performance for laptops. However, a new desktop chip that will dethrone the Threadripper Pro 7995WX is yet to arrive, while Intel’s new Core Ultra 275HX has provided a measly 6.8% increase in performance points on mobile.What’s quite baffling, though, is that AMD, Intel, and even Qualcomm have just released new desktop and laptop CPUs that should have increased performance levels, according to their marketing. While it’s true that the AMD Ryzen 9000 series (except for the new X3D chips) and Intel Arrow Lake Core Ultra 200S processors were a disappointment for many enthusiasts, these should have at least delivered a modest increase in performance, particularly in productivity applications.Passmark itself mused on X (formerly Twitter) that it could be that people are switching to more affordable machines that deliver lower power and performance. Or maybe Windows 11 is depressing performance scores versus Windows 10, especially as people transition to it with the upcoming demise of the latter. We've certainly seen plenty of examples of reduced performance in gaming with some of the newer versions of Windows 11, particularly as Intel and AMD struggled to upstream needed updates into the OS.At the moment, we don’t know the cause of this drop, but it could also be that we’re just in the first quarter of 2025. As more people get newer gear and run tests for the remainder of the year, this number could climb and reflect the performance of newer chips that arrived recently, or will arrive in the coming months.PassMark also muses that bloatware could contribute to the sudden decline in performance, but that seems like a longshot. In the end, the decline could simply be due to an odd interaction between the benchmark itself and the latest versions of Windows 11.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jordanian King meets Trump as tensions rise in Middle East | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOJRO1LwtUg</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rOJRO1LwtUg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 19:59:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Jordanian king's visit to the White House comes just days after Trump announced that America should to take over Gaza -- suggesting the 2 million Palestinians living there would leave for Jordan and Egypt.

Her owner and handler Randi Chylinski, 33, says she and Ziggy will at first start work with the Red Cross and through Therapy Dogs International. “She has a pretty clear understanding of the on-and-off switch for both jobs.

And if we are remotely serious as a country, we should regard that as a hostile action and embrace a wider array of tools in our response towards it.”Prime Minister Justin Trudeau initially characterized those comments as jokes. But he told business leaders last Friday that the idea of absorbing Canada “is a real thing” for Trump, because of Canada’s resource wealth.Trump said Sunday that he could easily enact economic policies that “would not allow Canada to be a viable country,” such as shutting down Canada’s auto sector.“Without the U.S., Canada doesn’t really have a country. They do almost all of their business with us,” Trump said.The diplomatic protocols governing how countries appoint a head of mission involve making a formal request for the receiving country to accept the appointment prior to the ambassador’s arrival. Arriving ambassadors later present their formal credentials to the governor general.Trump announced last November that he had tapped former Michigan congressman Pete Hoekstra to serve as the next American envoy to Canada.While Hoekstra still needs to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly has welcomed him as someone who understands the importance of cross-border trade.Greaves said the U.S. ambassador to Canada is a “patronage appointment” used by presidents to reward a key supporter with a plum post that involves overseeing an embassy whose staff do the heavy lifting of diplomatic relations.“To reject, or not accept, the credentials of the next U.S. ambassador would be to deprive Donald Trump of that plum patronage appointment that he can give to one of his supporters,” Greaves said. “That costs him something.”While Canada’s ambassadors in Washington sometimes have political ties, they’re generally appointed due to their diplomatic skills and have a major role in managing the country’s most important bilateral relationship.Greaves said he came up with the idea once it became clear that Trump wasn’t going to stop talking about annexing Canada.He said diplomacy exists to provide countries with “a way of increasing the costs” of hostile acts, without resorting to economic or military responses.Greaves argued Canada would block the appointment of an ambassador of any other country exhibiting the same behaviour — if, for example, Russia sent an ambassador after suggesting the Canadian Arctic was actually Russian territory.“We shouldn’t allow the fact that it’s the United States to overly colour what is an appropriate reaction under these circumstances,” he said.Greaves said that if Trump doesn’t change his tune, Canada should seriously consider barring him from the G7 leaders’ summit, planned for mid-June in Alberta.“Why would Canada host, as an honoured guest on its soil, the head of state of the country that is publicly, repeatedly and directly challenging our very sovereignty over the place that he would be coming to visit?” he said.Greaves said the U.S. likely would retaliate if Canada sought to block its ambassador, but he described that as part of the “price” Canada will have to pay to fight for its sovereignty.“That is the price of our independence, as decided by Donald Trump,” he said.Refusal to accredit an envoy is a response reserved for serious international disputes. In Canada, it’s even more rare than expulsions of foreign diplomats.In 2023, Joly told Parliament that Ottawa had declined to issue a diplomatic visa for “a political operative” from China because they were deeply linked to the Communist Party of China.In 2018, Ottawa barred three of Russia’s proposed diplomats from serving in Canada, and expelled four who were already accredited to Canada, in response to the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the U.K.In 1987, Ottawa refused to accredit Israel’s chosen military attaché Amos Yaron following reports of concerns about militia attacks on Palestinian civilians in Beirut during the 1982 Lebanon War.There have been unconfirmed reports in recent weeks that the Trump administration could block the U.K.’s chosen ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, who recently walked back previous comments that Trump was “reckless” and “a bully.”This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 11, 2025.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Introducing json_preprocessor</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1in7afe/introducing_json_preprocessor/</link><author>/u/hajhawa</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 19:38:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you ever feel like your json files need a bit more to make them interesting?

I discovered thermal comfort depends on four environmental factors: air temperature, heat radiation, airflow, and humidity. More importantly, staying within a specific range of these factors creates a comfortable environment for most people. This makes it possible to rely heavily on automation.I created an automated system controlled by a temperature dial. This, in turn, determines the fan speed and seat heating. If the cabin temperature deviates significantly from the set temperature, the system will increase the fan speed and seat heating or cooling accordingly.This led me to create the first design concept that used a mixed physical/touch interface. While the automated system sets the fan speed and seat heating, the driver can always override this.For the second iteration, I decided to remove the seat heating from the automated system as this is a highly personal feature that is better controlled individually. I also introduced a dial design that would sit on top of the touch display so the touch-sensitive center is used to temporarily override the automated system:While the concept showed promise, it remained theoretical. So, it was time to pick it back up and build a prototype.My initial plan was to mount a dial onto a touch display. Having tested various implementations, I discovered this technology is not good enough. Registering accurate touch events is tricky, and it renders the space around the dial useless as it has to remain empty to prevent accidental touch interactions when rotating the dial. So, instead of bringing a dial to the display, I decided to bring the display to the dial.That's when I came across Scott Bezek's open-source Smart Knob project. He used a brushless DC motor to emulate an analog dial. By playing with the force and resistance of the motor, it's possible to create fake detents that are totally controlled by software. This means you can simulate different types of haptic feedback, like different detent strengths and hard stops. Additionally, it has a vibration motor that simulates a button press when pushing down on the dial. Combined with a small display, it creates a fully customizable physical control that can simulate almost any type of interaction with a physical dial.After gaining significant attention in the maker community, Seedlabs turned it into a pre-fabricated development kit. Included are a couple of examples that show off the capability of the device.It was the perfect starting point for my exploration, so I ordered one and got to work.A rotary dial like this may look simple from a design perspective. But there is so much to explore! The fact that you can control everything about the software and haptic feedback is a fantastic opportunity to figure out what types of interactions are possible.When you see any physical control, you automatically get certain expectations from its physical properties like size, shape, and weight. These 'affordances,' as they are called, tell you how the object can be used. For example, a round dial communicates that it can be rotated. A big dial communicates that it controls important functions requiring more precision, whereas a small one controls fewer, less essential functions. Similarly, signifiers, such as labels, can explain something about the function of the control, the number of steps, or the state.Similarly, the haptic feedback from rotating the dial is a communication layer. When a dial controls different settings, such as the media source, it often has hard detents to indicate the significance of the change. The detents are smaller if the dial controls different values within a single feature, such as volume.I did a couple of experiments to better understand these properties of rotary dials. For example, I tried implementing a simple volume control with three different haptic patterns:1. Smooth, linear resistanceThis felt lifeless and artificial, even though it was technically the most precise.2. Subtle detents at regular intervalsThis is the most common way to handle a control like volume; therefore, it felt the most natural.3. Dynamic resistance that increased in force with volume levelIncreasing the resistance proportionally to the volume is an interesting concept that is hard to create with an analog dial. It, therefore, feels unusual, especially for a typical control like volume, but it has potential in other application areas.Based on my experiments, I created a set of guidelines for designing haptic interfaces with rotary inputs:Design Guidelines for Haptic InterfacesKeep haptic patterns consistent across similar operationsMuch like a door handle should communicate whether to pull or push a door, the dial sets expectations in our minds of how it feels and how heavy the rotation is. The haptic feedback should match that, and the interaction between similar operations should not be mixed. If volume and fan speed have the same type of value range, do not change the interaction pattern. Don't use a continuous rotation for one and a stepped rotation for the other.Allow for both precise and rapid adjustmentsCertain features, like volume, allow two different behaviors. During regular usage, passengers adjust the volume in small steps to match their preferences. However, on occasion, the passengers need to mute volume quickly. Both options should be possible. Another type of function where this is common is one with an off state. In the example below, the first position of the dial is the off state. Rotating the dial fully to the left instinctively means turning the function off.Synchronize physical and visual feedbackMatching the digital interface to the physical rotation of the dial is crucial. This comes down to two things. The first is matching the total rotation of the dial to the interface. If the dial can rotate 270°, the interface must also be 270°. The second is to match the detent's position to the interface's position. This is trickier than it seems. For example, if the total range of the dial is 180° and there are 6 detents, each detent is 30°. You would expect the UI to update between each detent. However, this leads to the UI feeling out of sync. Therefore, it's better to delay updating the UI. In my experiments, the UI updates when the dial is 20% past the detent, giving a more natural feeling.Scale detent strength inversely with value rangeThe detents should be subtle if the data ranges from [0,99]. If the range is small, like [0,3], detents have to be stronger to clearly communicate the position of the dial.Place stronger detents at significant valuesTo allow for finer communication, it can help to differentiate between major and minor values through detent strength. It adds a new layer of communication to the haptic feedback that is easy to understand. For example, temperature values with a decimal value.Vary resistance and step size to indicate extreme valuesAnother way to add a layer of communication to the haptic feedback is by increasing the force for extreme values. This indicates that the consequences of this action are more intense than those of normal values. For example, in an automated climate mode, setting a temperature that varies significantly from the current cabin temperature will result in the system taking more serious action to achieve this temperature.This is especially helpful in situations where the extreme values are dynamic. In my automated climate system, the cabin temperature isn't always the same; therefore, the same set temperature can have different consequences depending on how close the cabin temperature is to the set temperature.Another way of achieving this is by increasing the number of degrees for an important step. For example, an 'off' mode can be larger than the steps for the on mode.Add subtle "preview" resistance before state changesThe curve of the force should not be linear but logarithmic. This way, resistance increases the closer you move to the detent. This makes it clear when precisely the step is triggered, and you can feel it when you get close to the next step.After establishing the design principles, I implemented the concepts I created previously. I created a fake automated system with all three functions: temperature, fan speed, and seat heating. In my previous article, I concluded that adding seat heating to the automated system wasn't suitable as it is a highly personal function. This remains true, but I wanted to include it in the dial to explore whether controlling three different functions through one dial is possible.For temperature control, I added progressive haptic resistance to communicate the magnitude of changes. The further you adjust from the current temperature, the more resistance you feel, as setting a significantly higher temperature will increase the fan speed and seat heating.Fan speed and seat heating received the same haptic profiles - fan speed uses five clear steps, whereas seat heating uses 4, with the first one being the "off" position with stronger feedback. By pressing down on the dial, you can cycle through the functions.I highlight the active function through a small paginator at the bottom of the display. However, it should also communicate the relationship between the functions in the automated system. When fan speed and seat heating change after setting a temperature, the driver should be aware of that without having to cycle through the functions. I explored this further in Figma:Being able to modify the angle, force, and detents of the dial through software is amazing and gave me a better understanding of the effect of different kinds of haptic feedback on usability. It's fun and insightful to update the different values until they are perfect.Showing three different data types in one dial is possible but definitely the maximum. When adding a fourth function, keeping track of your position in the interface without looking down becomes too difficult. One of the main challenges is the small display that needs to show a lot of information. Since I created an automated system in which all three data types are linked, it is challenging to communicate this link through a tiny display, especially if it's intended to be used while driving. It becomes a lot easier if there are only two functions — temperature and fan speed. This makes more sense conceptually, and there is now enough space in the interface to clearly communicate the status of the automated system.This setup is also my recommendation after all my experiments. A rotary dial with two functions is easy to understand and operate. Relying on an automated system keeps the number of interactions to a minimum, allowing the driver to override it easily if needed. Ideally, seat heating is also a physical control that enables passengers to set their preferred setting with one button press instead of cycling through the strength with multiple presses.Example of implementations todayI want to highlight two carmakers with similar interesting solutions. The first is Jaguar, who had a clever solution for a dial with three functions by adding a depth dimension.By default, the dial controls temperature. Pushing down on the dial activates the seat heating, and pulling up on the dial activates the fan speed. It's easy to learn and operate while keeping your eyes on the road. Unfortunately, like most carmakers, Jaguar has discontinued physical climate controls in favor of touch screens.The second carmaker is Skoda. They have an interesting concept with three 'Smart Dials' in current higher-end models. Each passenger has a dial to control the temperature, and by pressing down, they control the seat heating. The driver can configure the middle dial to control up to 6 different functions, such as volume, drive mode, fan speed, and air direction. It's a simple and superb design that deserves more praise, especially considering today's trend of touch interfaces.In my most popular article, I explain the rise of touch screens in cars. Touch screens are a necessary evil, especially for more complicated interactions such as navigation. However, frequent, simpler interactions like climate controls should not be in a touch interface.The often-cited reason for this is cost. However, surprisingly, it's often the budget brands like Skoda and Renault that offer physical controls today, showing that it's not simply a matter of cost, but of priority. Carmakers with touch-only interfaces prioritize cost and marketing over ergonomics and safety.There is an inherent satisfaction and quality in operating physical controls. For years, brands like Mercedes prided themselves on spending thousands of hours perfecting the feel of their switches and buttons. The feeling of operating a physical control gives the car an inherent quality and character. This feeling is gone with touch screens and, therefore, in most modern vehicles.I want to see more carmakers bring back physical controls and consider them a prominent part of the in-car experience. As I've demonstrated with this project, there is a lot to explore when designing physical controls, and I hope my project will inspire others to do the same.

The report, produced with the University of Chicago's Cyber Policy Initiative, challenges the effectiveness of "red teaming" -- where security experts probe AI systems for vulnerabilities -- saying this approach alone cannot adequately protect against emerging threats. "Public red teaming an AI model is not possible because documentation for what these models are supposed to even do is fragmented and the evaluations we include in the documentation are inadequate," said Sven Cattell, who leads DEF CON's AI Village. 

Nearly 500 participants tested AI models at the conference, with even newcomers successfully finding vulnerabilities. The researchers called for adopting frameworks similar to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system used in traditional cybersecurity since 1999. This would create standardized ways to document and address AI vulnerabilities, rather than relying on occasional security audits.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why some workers won&apos;t have time to adapt to AI | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhbQvcnugVc</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/nhbQvcnugVc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 19:00:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI will replace millions of jobs, with the biggest risk posed to clerical jobs, which will primarily affect women, says Gilbert Houngbo, Director-General of the International Labour Organization.

Solutions to climate change, biodiversity loss, health inequities and other global crises will also rely on insights that bridge many fields.Yet interdisciplinary research is still sidelined in many countries. Even though these papers attract more citations and have more impact on research, interdisciplinary research proposals tend to be less likely to receive funding than are those with a narrower scope.Some countries have adjusted their research funding strategies accordingly. For example, between 2016 and 2018, UK research councils awarded 30% more grants to interdisciplinary investigators than they had a decade earlier, with 44% of funded projects in 2018 spanning at least two research subjects. A similar move has been made in the United States: between 2015 and 2020, university departments that submitted some interdisciplinary grant proposals received almost five times more funding — in terms of total and individual awards — from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) than did those that submitted in only one discipline.Alas, this isn’t the case in Japan. The nation’s funding agencies still mostly support research in tight disciplinary boundaries, such as engineering or chemistry. Specialists who evaluate these grant proposals tend to favour work in fields that they are familiar with over interdisciplinary studies they do not understand well.This narrow approach is leading to substantial underfunding of interdisciplinary research in Japan. It also means that the nation is missing out on breakthroughs. Japan’s natural resources are limited, and its economy has long relied on science and technology. The decline in its research and innovation is unmistakable, as indicated by the country’s share of the world’s top 10% of most-cited research articles, which has dropped from 6% to 2% over the past two decades or so.As scientists and engineers based in Japanese research institutions, we urge the government and funding agencies to do more to support interdisciplinary research — or risk eroding the country’s global standing in science and its economy. Here we highlight five directions to foster such a shift.Fund people, not projectsWe argue that Japanese funding agencies should pivot from funding projects to supporting talented researchers. Such a model has proven to be effective in leading institutions worldwide. For example, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s (HHMI) Investigator Program provides outstanding scientists with flexible, long-term funding to pursue high-impact biomedical research — some US$11 million over a seven-year term, which can be renewed. This approach has led to groundbreaking discoveries, including the mechanistic understanding of circadian rhythms, the computational prediction of protein folding and the discovery of RNA interference.Similarly, in Germany, the Max Planck Society prioritizes curiosity-driven research that has long-term objectives over immediate applications. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and providing institute directors with generous internal funding, free from the continual need to secure external grants, this strategy has enabled breakthroughs including the development of CRISPR–Cas9 as a gene-editing tool and structural insights into ribosomes.Japan does have some programmes to support talented researchers, but these are too timid. The Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), for example, dedicate some funds to basic science and some to curiosity-driven research. But the JST adopts a top-down approach, which often favours research on trending topics and can miss more-original ideas or projects . And the annual budget for the JSPS’s main grant programme, the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI), has remained stagnant for the past decade. Adjusted for inflation and the weakening yen, the average funding per project has halved since 2013.However, one Japanese institution has adopted researcher-focused funding with great success: the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST). Unlike national universities, which are funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, OIST is a private university that is funded by Japan’s Cabinet Office. Launched in 2011, it has a horizontal organizational structure and a strong commitment to diversity and interdisciplinary collaboration (see ‘Steps to success’). OIST is now ranked as Japan’s leading research institute by the Nature Index, and around 20% of its publications involve contributions across more than one discipline. More Japanese institutions should follow its lead.At the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), faculty members receive core funding for five years — with flexibility in what to do with it. Unlike many other universities, in which laboratories must cover the costs of core facilities and technical staff, access to these resources at OIST is provided free of charge. This fosters collaboration and enables high-risk, high-reward projects. A review of each faculty member every five years ensures accountability, with continued support granted only to those who demonstrate significant achievements.OIST also operates without conventional departments, helping scientists from different fields to collaborate. The buildings host open spaces, lounges, shared kitchens and open desk areas that encourage casual interactions. PhD students must also rotate through multiple labs during their first year to widen their horizons. These rotations facilitate the exchange of ideas and technologies, embedding interdisciplinary collaboration into the fabric of the institution.Although further progress is needed, including in terms of gender and disability, OIST fosters a greater diversity in its community than do other Japanese institutions. This is partly because it attracts scholars from around the world. In 2024, more than 60% of faculty members and 80% of students at OIST were not Japanese citizens, bringing a dynamic mix of perspectives and expertise.Embrace high-stakes projectsInterdisciplinary research is often perceived as riskier than more conventional, single-discipline work. This might be because it can be hard to learn concepts and methods, and even communicate efficiently, across disciplines. And priorities between fields can conflict.To overcome these challenges, Japanese funding agencies should consider adopting a ‘high risk, high impact’ funding model, similar to that of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which anticipates a success rate of just 50%. They should recognize that even ‘unsuccessful’ high-risk projects can generate valuable knowledge, contributing to broader scientific and technological advancements. The DARPA funding model has inspired others, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), launched in the NIH to drive biomedical breakthroughs.Another example is the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in California, which supports interdisciplinary teams comprising biologists, engineers and data scientists to work on ambitious goals, such as the eradication of infectious diseases. It provides substantial funding over several years to enable teams to pivot research directions in response to emerging challenges. Success is assessed through regular milestone-based evaluations. Projects that show limited potential are promptly terminated, ensuring that resources can be reallocated to more-promising endeavours.In Japan, we are not advocating for existing funds to be redistributed. Rather, Japanese policymakers should allocate money to high-risk, high-reward projects from a separate pot, managed through dedicated DARPA-like programmes.Initiatives such as the JST’s Diversity and Inclusiveness programme aim to lessen the homogeneity of the research workforce — for example, through awards and networking opportunities for women in science and by providing support or extensions for life events as well as for childcare and caregiving commitments — which tend to fall mostly on women (see page 295). This is laudable, but these efforts should be more widespread: they should be extended across genders and also include funding agency officers, programme managers and reviewers.Japan’s funding agencies should also ensure that their own decision makers are less homogeneous in terms of their discipline, background, gender, age, nationality and culture. This would help to favour interdisciplinary research, which by nature weaves different approaches together and can benefit from being planned, conducted and assessed by a diverse community.The role of immigration in boosting diversity should also be recognized.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SEDA&apos;s Flagship Verification Module To Secure A $120 Billion Industry</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/sedas-flagship-verification-module-to-secure-a-$120-billion-industry-eb8waku?source=rss</link><author>Chainwire</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 18:28:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[NEW YORK, New York, February 11th, 2025/Chainwire/--SEDA has announced the Interoperability Verification Module (IVM) framework to set an industry standard for cross-chain verification for all routes, across any VM.\
Today,  announced the first-of-its-kind  framework. SEDA IVMs are a plug-and-play verification solution for interoperability protocols, adding significantly upgraded security, near-instant horizontal scaling, and increased decentralization out of the box.\
Interoperability providers integrating the SEDA IVM can access a hyper-specialized framework for independent, permissionless verification of any cross-chain transaction across all routes. \
The  leverages a multi-layer verification process consisting of an independent overlay network, decentralized solvers, and a combination of private and public RPC data providers. With , the SEDA IVM presents a critical piece of industry-needed security infrastructure. \
Built to offer a robust, scalable, and customizable module, the IVM provides independent decentralized verification for millions of transactions across thousands of networks.Key features and benefits of the SEDA IVM include:Industry-wide data parity with a singular security zone.Built-in liveness guarantees.Programmable design to suit specific needs of bridge, solver, and abstraction layers.Permissionless access and deployments."The demand for robust interoperability infrastructure has surged as users and developers engage with hundreds of specialized networks," said Peter Mitchell, CEO and Co-founder of SEDA. \
"Over the last two years, the interoperability sector has expanded dramatically, achieving a transaction volume of over $123 billion in 2024. Projections indicate this sector could reach over $250 billion in 2025. Our IVMs represent a significant advancement for Interop 3.0, allowing any interoperability provider to customize parameters within the SEDA IVM framework, ensuring independent verification across all routes through a single deployment."\
Parallel to a message relayed between chains, the IVM automatically initiates a secure verification sequence, in which a dedicated secret committee of independent overlay nodes is formed to query RPC data on the source chain. \
Results are returned via a commit-reveal scheme for data integrity and preventing manipulation, after which protocol-defined instructions filter and order results before being batched on SEDA's main chain. \
Data results are secured with tamper-proof cryptographic guarantees before being relayed by solvers to the destination chain.\
By plugging into SEDA’s distributed verification architecture, interoperability providers inherit security and liveness guarantees associated with SEDA’s Network design, consisting of a performant layer one, a highly decentralized overlay network, and a censorship-resistant solver network.\
This design mitigates collusion risk and downtime commonly associated with default multi-sig relay setups, which secure over By decoupling verification, interoperability providers can focus on scaling services to thousands of new chains, allowing SEDA to provide specialized verification for all routes. is a programmable oracle infrastructure that enables builders on any network to connect application-specific data feeds in seconds.:::tip

And they’re still one of the most efficient ways to store data.” Yet open questions remain about how they work, he said. “This paper answers a couple of them in surprising ways.”Hash tables have become ubiquitous in computing, partly because of their simplicity and ease of use. They’re designed to allow users to do exactly three things: “query” (search for) an element, delete an element, or insert one into an empty slot. The first hash tables date back to the early 1950s, and computer scientists have studied and used them ever since. Among other things, researchers wanted to figure out the speed limits for some of these operations. How fast, for example, could a new search or insertion possibly be?The answer generally depends on the amount of time it takes to find an empty spot in a hash table. This, in turn, typically depends on how full the hash table is. Fullness can be described in terms of an overall percentage — this table is 50% full, that one’s 90% — but researchers often deal with much fuller tables. So instead, they may use a whole number, denoted by , to specify how close the hash table is to 100% full. If  is 100, then the table is 99% full. If  is 1,000, the table is 99.9% full. This measure of fullness offers a convenient way to evaluate how long it should take to perform actions like queries or insertions.Researchers have long known that for certain common hash tables, the expected time required to make the worst possible insertion — putting an item into, say, the last remaining open spot — is proportional to . “If your hash table is 99% full,” Kuszmaul said, “it makes sense that you would have to look at around 100 different positions to find a free slot.”In a 1985 paper, the computer scientist Andrew Yao, who would go on to win the A.M. Turing Award, asserted that among hash tables with a specific set of properties, the best way to find an individual element or an empty spot is to just go through potential spots randomly — an approach known as uniform probing. He also stated that, in the worst-case scenario, where you’re searching for the last remaining open spot, you can never do better than . for 40 years, most computer scientists assumed that Yao’s conjecture was true.Krapivin was not held back by the conventional wisdom for the simple reason that he was unaware of it. “I did this without knowing about Yao’s conjecture,”  he said. His explorations with tiny pointers led to a new kind of hash table — one that did not rely on uniform probing. And for this new hash table, the time required for worst-case queries and insertions is proportional to (log ) — far faster than . This result directly contradicted Yao’s conjecture. Farach-Colton and Kuszmaul helped Krapivin show that (log ) is the optimal, unbeatable bound for the popular class of hash tables Yao had written about.“This result is beautiful in that it addresses and solves such a classic problem,” said Guy Blelloch of Carnegie Mellon.“It’s not just that they disproved [Yao’s conjecture], they also found the best possible answer to his question,” said Sepehr Assadi of the University of Waterloo.  “We could have gone another 40 years before we knew the right answer.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reviving the joy and honor of working with your hands (2015)</title><link>https://richmond.com/holmberg-reviving-the-joy-and-honor-of-working-with-your-hands-will-strengthen-our-nation/article_d8130166-855d-53b6-94e1-cb735edcd7cc.html</link><author>skadamat</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 18:23:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Only One Big Economy Is Aiming for Paris Agreement&apos;s 1.5C Goal</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/02/11/1815209/only-one-big-economy-is-aiming-for-paris-agreements-15c-goal?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 18:14:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Seven of the 10 world's largest economies missed a deadline on Monday to submit updated emissions-cutting plans to the United Nations -- and only one, the UK, outlined a strategy for the next decade that keeps pace with expectations staked out under the Paris Agreement. From a report: All countries taking part in the UN process had been due to send their national climate plans for the next decade by Feb. 10, but relatively few got theirs in on time. Dozens more nations will likely come forward with updated plans within the next nine months before the UN's annual climate summit, known as COP30, kicks off in Brazil. 

The lack of urgency among the more than 170 countries that failed to file what climate diplomats refer to as "nationally determined contributions" (NDCs) adds to concerns about the world's continuing commitment to keeping warming to well below 2C, and ideally 1.5C, relative to pre-industrial levels. Virtually every country adopted those targets a decade ago in the landmark agreement signed in Paris, but a series of lackluster UN summits last year has added to a sense of backsliding. US President Donald Trump has already started the process of pulling the world's second-largest emitter out of the global agreement once again.

But what is behind their success? How did the leading crypto investors, traders, and entrepreneurs achieve their results in this field? In today's article, we will look at the most high-profile success stories that have become an example for other investors and analyze the key factors that allowed them to achieve such impressive results.The First Step to Success: Early InvestmentsProbably everyone in the industry has heard stories at least once about a guy who sold his 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas, or someone who accidentally threw away a hard drive with 8,000 BTC on it. But have you heard the  of the man who accidentally became a Bitcoin millionaire?\
Well, the hero of the story is Kristoffer Koch, a Norwegian engineer who, in 2009, had no idea that his academic curiosity would turn him into a cryptocurrency millionaire. When the price of 1 Bitcoin was even less than $1, Koch was working on his dissertation on encryption. Interested in the potential of the decentralized digital currency, he decided to invest $22-$27, purchasing approximately 5000 BTC. At the time, Bitcoin was unpopular, so Koch's investment was more of a technical study than a financial one. Immediately afterward, the man forgot about his small investment and lived his usual life, not paying attention to the changes around digital assets.\
However, everything changed in 2013, when the price of the first cryptocurrency experienced a significant jump, attracting the attention of many investors. So, when all the headlines in the media were about Bitcoin and its $200 price, the engineer remembered his long-forgotten investment. When he accessed his wallet, he discovered that his wealth was about $886,000. However, Koch did not succumb to the madness of his newfound wealth but made a practical decision by purchasing a new apartment for a portion of his Bitcoins.\
Given his story, two main strategies led to a successful outcome. The first is the initial coin offering (ICO), when investors invest in projects at the start-up stage, allowing them to make a significant profit if they are successful. The second, albeit random, in his case is HODL. The essence of this strategy is to buy cryptocurrencies for long-term storage in anticipation of a significant increase in value.From $30 a Day to a Million: How the DCA Strategy Changed the Investor's LifeAnother investment success story: a user with the nickname regothetrader turned a daily investment of $30 into a portfolio worth $1 million in almost 8 years. At the age of 22, he started his strategy of gradual Bitcoin purchases. Every 12 hours, regardless of the asset's exchange rate, Rego invested $30.\
Talking about his  on social network X, he admitted that such discipline required personal sacrifice: ‘I sacrificed going out with my friends to allocate to this belief. I stayed home. I didn't buy a new car. I didn't buy fancy things. I kept it minimal.’\
On 13 November, he announced that his persistent DCA strategy had brought in $1,000,000 in 7 years, 10 months, and 12 days. In total, Rego has invested $86,370 in cryptocurrency.\
‘The truth is, Bitcoin is not a risk, it is a matter of understanding. The more you learn about it, the more obvious it becomes.’ the investor emphasized.\
The dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy involves spreading purchases over predetermined intervals, regardless of price. According to a  conducted by , 59% of investors use DCA as their primary investment strategy. Among the most common reasons they cite are hedging against market volatility, maintaining consistent investment habits, and eliminating emotions in trading.Know Your Product: The Role of Research and KnowledgeMost of the success stories are about young investors, but one of the most incredible stories is about a teenager who started investing when he was just 12 years old.\
Erik Finman is an ordinary guy who managed to turn his Bitcoin investments into a huge fortune by the time he was 18. His family was not wealthy, but Eric's life changed when his grandmother gave him $1000. As he had always been interested in technology and innovation, he learned about Bitcoin in 2011. Seeing the potential of the new digital currency, Eric decided to invest his $1000 and bought his first Bitcoins with it. At that time, the world was skeptical about cryptocurrencies, and the asset itself was trading at only $12 per coin.\
For the next few years, Eric studied and gradually traded coins. At the age of 15, after falling out with his parents over his unwillingness to continue his studies at school, he decided to sell some of his investments. Having received $100,000, he invested it in his first business, which he started in his room. Finman really disliked going to school, so he created his own company, Botangle, where teachers conducted their classes online. After 2 years, he decided to sell his business for 300 BTC. So, when the first cryptocurrency rate exceeded $2700, 17-year-old Erik Finman became a millionaire.\
Looking at Finman's story, one can understand that he used similar strategies as Koch. However, their approach to business was different. Finman was a curious guy, so he dove deep into the world of cryptocurrencies, learning everything he could about Bitcoin and blockchain technology. He didn't just invest blindly; he decided to research the market, study trends, and understand Bitcoin's full potential.Investors on the Wave: How the Launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA Generated Million-Dollar ProfitsFollowing the recent inauguration of US President Donald Trump, the crypto industry has been rocked by a wave of new profit stories. The reason for this was the launch of the $TRUMP meme coin on 17 January. The value of the coin skyrocketed from $0.18 to $3.7 after the launch announcement. Within an hour of the launch, one trader managed to earn $20 million. According to  analysts, about 90 seconds after the announcement, the trader spent ~$1.1 million USDC, purchasing 5.97 million $TRUMP. A few hours later, these tokens were valued at over $116 million.\
Later, the trader decided to distribute his assets among 10 different Solana wallets and began to gradually sell the coins the next day. According to the research company Bubblemaps, by the morning of Monday, January 20, he had  $85 million worth of TRUMP, leaving $75 million worth of tokens. However, this was not the end of his story, as First Lady Melania Trump followed her husband's example and issued her own meme coin, which was used by the trader. One of the wallets associated with the user bought a huge amount of MELANIA tokens a minute and a half after Melania's post on Truth Social. To finance the purchase of MELANIA, the trader sold $45 million worth of TRUMP, which led to a drop in the token's value of almost 50% on Sunday evening, according to Bubblemaps.\
Other anonymous traders who made millions on the First Lady's tokens did not go unnoticed, either. One of them  2,500 SOL ($688,000) to buy 5.2 million MELANIA for $0.13 and sold them four days later, earning a profit of 6208%, or $42.7 million.\
The stories of these anonymous traders once again emphasize the importance of early investment. But don't forget about one of the main risks - FOMO, the fear of missing out on an opportunity, which can force you to make unpredictable decisions that lead to large losses.How to Optimize Your Trading?Optimizing the crypto trading process is a key factor in increasing its efficiency and profitability. Therefore, the use of appropriate tools will help to make this process more convenient and efficient, as well as significantly simplify it.Investing is a great opportunity to grow your capital, but beginners often encounter common mistakes that can be costly. Therefore, to minimize risks, you need to understand these mistakes and know how to avoid them.A responsible approach, patience, and a willingness to constantly learn are some of the best allies in the crypto space. Avoid common mistakes and let your investments bring profit in the long run.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hamas leader dismisses Trump&apos;s threat on what happens if hostages not freed soon | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnq2wbEDliU</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Rnq2wbEDliU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 17:53:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A senior Hamas leader has dismissed a threat by Donald Trump that 'all hell is going to break out' if the militant group doesn't release all remaining Israeli hostages by Saturday. Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters news agency that the only way to secure the hostages' release is to respect the ceasefire agreement. Hamas said on Monday that it would delay further hostage releases, because Israel had violated the terms of the ceasefire.
 
The militant group accuses Israel of targeting Palestinians in Gaza with airstrikes and breaking part of the agreement on the humanitarian aid being allowed into Gaza. Five swaps have taken place since the current deal took effect last month. So far 21 hostages captured during the October 7th terror attacks in Israel have been released, and 766 Palestinian prisoners and detainees have been freed.

If you’ve built an app with React Native before you’re familiar with the pains of working with both Xcode and Android Studio, writing tons of boilerplate before you can even start making the app, setting up state management, and of course going through the dreaded app review. We decided to build a platform that would make the app development process faster.We’ve seen the success of new code-gen platforms like v0 and wanted something for React Native that goes further. We built an AI app generator that takes a user's prompt and creates a custom React Native app with an instant live preview.a0.dev is great for quickly prototyping components and screens in React Native and users are able to copy the code from our generator into their preferred development environment. Our landing page has a couple of example prompts, but we encourage you to get creative when trying it out. We’ve had success generating not only functional screens like an Instagram Feed but also 2d games like Minesweeper or Flappy Bird.Our chat has a “UI Expert” and “Advanced Logic” model users can switch between depending on the task at hand. Users can upgrade from working on a single screen to creating a full app by clicking on the “Need a Full App” button in the top right of the page. This changes the scope from a standalone chat with a single file to a full project that can include multiple chats and files. We launched an IOS app that users can download in order to preview the app on a physical device. We find that many apps look and feel better on a physical device so we recommend trying it out.Our goal is to continue to improve the app generator while adding more features to help developers get their apps to the app store and make money from those apps. The main features on our roadmap right now are a Supabase integration and a “one click submit” button to let developers publish their app to the App Store.There are a few limitations to note. We’re working on releasing our Android app, but Android users should be able to preview their app using the Expo Go App. The app is running React Native Web in the browser so any dependencies that don’t support web won’t work with the web preview but should work on the phone. There are also some dependencies that our system can’t handle because they require native modules that aren’t packaged into our app currently.We hope you guys will check it out and try making an app with a0.dev. We’re available on Discord around the clock to help developers with any problems they may face and want to guide people to actually releasing their app on the App Store. Let us know what features you’d like to see and any problems you’ve faced building apps, we’d love to hear about your experience.We dropped the need to sign up for the first message so you can just jump in and try it out.Looking forward to your thoughts!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Another person targeted by Paragon spyware comes forward</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/another-person-targeted-by-paragon-spyware-comes-forward/</link><author>Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 17:07:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Four people have so far come forward as victims of the Paragon spyware campaign targeting WhatsApp users, including one journalist and three activists. © 2024 TechCrunch.

Did the Catholic Church help them? A research team spent months investigating.

After two teenagers accused Catholic priest Dieter Scholz of abuse in 1963, he disappeared overseas. He went to work in Bolivia as a missionary with the approval of his archdiocese. After his return to Germany, he went on to abuse many others. Even though church authorities were aware of the accusations against him, he was allowed to continue in his post. Priest Josef Zottmann was also able to vanish abroad. In his case, he was trying to escape a warrant for his arrest. Five school girls had reported him to the police for sexual abuse in 1969. The diocese of Eichstätt continued to finance Zottmann abroad by concealing it as a "mission donation.” High-ranking church officials in Germany and Brazil were informed about the police investigation, but they did not cooperate with the authorities. Zottmann returned to Germany in the 1980s after the crimes reached their statute of limitations.

Lawyer Bettina Janssen has also come across other cases that match this profile. The Catholic Church, including the German Bishops’ Conference, has commissioned her to look through their files. She concluded that: "People found diverse ways of keeping priests under cover and concealing their ties to a diocese, of sweeping incidents under the rug, and of providing financial support.” Janssen regards such practices as "a form of obstruction of justice”. No consideration at all was given to the victims. 

So did the Catholic Church consciously hide perpetrators of abuse abroad? A documentary team went looking for answers in Germany and South America.

An altcoin, or alternative coin, is a cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin. Altseasons are usually driven by a shift in the liquidity of the crypto market.\
Due to the bullish sentiments of the crypto market during pre-altseasons, investors tend to search for more profitable opportunities in the market, shifting their attention from Bitcoin (BTC) to other promising altcoins.\
This shift in investors' attention and interest often results in an increased flow of liquidity or money from Bitcoin to altcoins, causing their prices to rise, and their outperforming Bitcoin.\
Conversely, Bitcoin season is a period when Bitcoin outperforms altcoins. Due to Bitcoin’s status as digital gold, investors tend to shift their focus from altcoins to Bitcoin, especially when the market is bearish, resulting in the prices of altcoins falling significantly.The first altseason occurred between 2017 and 2018. Bitcoin’s market dominance dropped significantly during this period, falling from 87% to 32%. Conversely, altcoins rose in value. This surge was a result of the ICO boom.\
An ICO, or Initial Coin Offering, is a fundraising method used by blockchain companies to finance their projects. A blockchain company often sells its tokens to investors in exchange for capital. The logic behind this was that these tokens' prices would rise upon the project's launch.\
Notable ICOs launched during this period included Ethereum, Tron, and Polkadot. The ICO boom resulted in several altcoins reaching their all-time highs, including Ether (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC). Conversely, Bitcoin experienced a significant decline, dropping from its peak price of over $20,000 to less than $6,000.The next altseason occurred between 2020 and 2021. The opportunity to explore other aspects of blockchain technology was the main driver of this altseason. It was during this period decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and memecoins became popular.\
According to , approximately $189 billion was locked in DeFi protocols by the end of 2021, a 767% increase over 2020.\
The NFT market also skyrocketed. According to , approximately $2.57 billion worth of NFT art was sold in 2021, up from $20 million in 2020, representing a 12,750% increase.\
Memecoins were not left out, as meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) gained significant popularity during this period.\
All these significantly affected the altcoin market, causing it to rise from 30% to 62%. The crypto market also reached an all-time high of $3 trillion. On the other hand, Bitcoin dominance dropped, falling from 70% to 30%.Signs That an Altcoin Season Has StartedIncrease in Altcoin DominanceOne major sign that an altcoin season has started is the increase in altcoin dominance, which is the percentage of the total crypto market cap made up of altcoins.\
It is calculated by subtracting Bitcoin dominance from 100%, that is: Altcoin dominance = 100% – Bitcoin dominance.  You can get the Bitcoin dominance value in real-time by checking crypto aggregator sites like  and .Trading volume is the total amount of a cryptocurrency that is traded (bought and sold) on a crypto exchange within a given time period.  Due to the increase in the flow of liquidity from Bitcoin to altcoins, the trading volume of altcoins tends to increase during altseasons. Thus, an increase in the trading volume of altcoins is a good sign an altseason is about to begin.Increase in Altcoin Season Index and Ethereum-to-Bitcoin Price Ratio (ETH/BTC)\
The altcoin season index is a metric used to determine how well altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 30-, 60-, or 90-day period. Its value can be reliably used to predict if an altseason has started.\
If the altcoin season index is between 0 and 25, it indicates Bitcoin is dominating the crypto market. If it is between 25 and 75, it means the crypto market is experiencing a mixed performance.\
If, however, the altcoin season index is between 75 and 100, it means altcoins are outperforming Bitcoins, indicating an altseason.\
The ETH/BTC price ratio can also be used to determine an altseason. A rising ETH/BTC ratio means Ether (ETH) outperforms Bitcoin (BTC), a trigger that might lead to an altseasonHow to Benefit From an Altcoin Season?Research and Diversify Your PortfolioThough altseasons can be profitable, they can also be risky, as a trader or investor might end up purchasing an altcoin that performs poorly. That’s why it’s important you research before investing in any altcoin.\
To begin your research, you can use website tools like Coinmarketcap and Coingecko to check the metrics of an altcoin, including its dominance, trading volume, and market cap.\
While researching is important, do not forget an important aspect of investing—diversification. Diversifying your crypto portfolio is important as it helps mitigate the risks associated with the volatility of the crypto market.\
Are you looking for the best platform that offers a variety of altcoins to help diversify your crypto portfolio? MEXC is your best deal.\
In addition to being one of the best and most reliable cryptocurrency exchanges, here are some of the benefits of using MEXC:With over 3,000 tokens listed and new listings occurring almost daily, MEXC stands out from other cryptocurrency exchanges by offering the most cryptocurrency collections. Its efficient infrastructure and well-organized listing process allow it to list cryptocurrencies swiftly and early. Thus, investors can acquire lesser-known and emerging cryptocurrency tokens even before they are listed on other exchanges.Liquidity is a key feature of the MEXC exchange platform. According to industry reports, , having a spot trading depth of $3.11 billion. It also has a futures depth of over $9.1 billion, surpassing the total of major exchanges. \
With its high liquidity and extremely low slippage, MEXC provides a favorable trading environment that allows traders to execute trades swiftly and efficiently. Little wonder, it is the crypto hub of more than 30 million users from over 170 countries.Extremely Low Trading FeeAnother unique benefit of the MEXC crypto exchange is its extremely low trading fees. MEXC offers a 0.05% taker fee for spot trading and a 0.01% maker and 0.04% taker fee for futures trading. The result? Traders can maximize profits during altseasons.\
Due to its exceptional services, MEXC has become the go-to crypto exchange for millions of users, achieving ground-breaking milestones.\
To illustrate with examples, here are two of MEXC’s achievements this past year:Ranking among the top centralized exchanges (CEXs) for spot and derivative trading.According to the data obtained from Token Insight, MEXC ranked 6th and 5th among CEXs for spot trading and derivative trading in 2024. \
In fact, its derivative trading volume increased by 132.35%, more than twice its 2023 volume. This is quite remarkable, highlighting MEXC’s hgh liquidity, wide user base, and diverse crypto offerings that cater to the needs of all kinds of traders.\
Thus, traders can easily buy cryptocurrencies, including memecoins, with minimal price slippage. MEXC also offers futures and margin trading options that allows traders to benefit from the price volatility of cryptocurrencies, including memecoins.Having the largest market share among CEXs.Market share refers to the proportion of trading activity a cryptocurrency exchange has compared to other exchanges. \

This design scales well and has low setup and maintenance costs. A side cache can be added to an existing web application backend to speed up the loading of all types of data, from database records to larger chunks like complete JSON or HTML responses. By setting an expiration time, "lazy caching” (or “lazy loading”) can be implemented, meeting the user's tolerance for stale data without the complexities of cache invalidation. Many excellent open-source solutions are available both on-premises and in the cloud, memcache and redis are considered the most popular. A caching scheme like this has been used in all the projects I have worked on.\
As system load increases, challenges inevitably emerge. Imagine your web application processing millions of requests daily. During peak traffic hours, users experience significant delays and occasional errors. To mitigate these issues, you expand your caching infrastructure by adding additional instances, expecting the increased cache size to resolve the bottlenecks. However, the performance issues persist, and your application continues to struggle under the load. This scenario, which I encountered repeatedly in the projects I worked on, necessitates a careful re-evaluation of our approach to caching under high demand.Large technology companies often address such challenges with sophisticated software and intricate architectural changes. However, these solutions are not always accessible or cost-effective for smaller teams or organizations. Techniques such as implementing middleware proxies for request batching or adopting customized communication protocols may not align with your system's constraints. This article presents a practical method that my colleagues and I successfully employed to address similar challenges in large-scale projects.Latency spikes at top percentilesOne of the frequent problems we encountered was high response times observed in top percentiles like p99, while mean and median times looked great. These high response times occurred due to the need to make database reads when cache keys were missing.I created a simulation to represent a typical workload for a web application we used to have (see the Simulation section below for more details). This model application handles 100 requests per second for a single type of abstract key. The keys' popularity follows a Pareto distribution, with two-thirds of user requests concentrated among the first 1,000 keys out of a total of 1 million keys.Mean cache read time is about 50 times higher than database read time. Cache expiration time is 20 minutes.The p99 response times for these top 1000 keys are extremely high (top left chart), while the mean and median response times are within an acceptable threshold. The long tail of less popular keys isn’t considered here because their hit ratio is significantly lower, thus making caching much less efficient for them beforehand.\
But are high values at 99th percentile for popular keys that bad? That means that just about 1% of key reads are slow. Though it depends on your application and its usage patterns, this is generally unfavourable. Think about the following real-world scenarios:A single user's request fetches hundreds of keys — a typical case for social and news feeds etc. Though only 1 out of 100 keys are slow but almost every user request is slow because of that;Hundreds of users request the same key at the same moment — a common thing pattern for any popular site. When this key expires, all these requests go straight to the database, multiplying its load, slowing down the whole backend.I want to emphasize that this happens not to “some requests” but to the most popular ones, which represent the core of your users’ demand.Setting keys expiration time to infinity could solve the problem with peaking loading times. Unfortunately, this also denies “lazy caching” and demands cache invalidation mechanisms.  Is it possible to eliminate the issue of key expiration while still providing data that is acceptably up to date?Dynamically extending keys expiration timeThe desire to serve fresh data while maintaining low response times and database load is inherently contradictory. The ideal solution would be to know in advance if a retrieved key from the cache is about to expire and update it if necessary, preferably in the background. Here is an example solution written in pseudo-python code:cache_response = cache.get(key)
if cache_response is not None: 
  if random() < α:
    run async: # this block will run in background and not delay the response
      db_response = dabase.get(key)
      if db_response is not None:
          # note cas_token, see explanation for CAS below
          cache.set(key, db_response.value, cache_response.cas_token) 

  # returning value to the user
  return cache_response.value 
\
We read a key from cache and, if successful, with small probability set its value again, also extending the expiration time. This involves reading the key from the database to check for updates.To avoid race conditions, CAS or Check and Set mode must be used. CAS ensures that the cache update only happens if the data hasn't been modified by another process since it was last read, maintaining data consistency.The key set should be done asynchronously to avoid delaying user responses. Even if it isn't possible, it may be still beneficial to update the key blocking the user.Choosing the optimal probability  depends on your traffic pattern and is generally recommended to be between 1% and 10%. Higher values increase database load without significantly affecting popular keys.\
In systems where keys are not frequently updated, expiration times are longer, and request rates are high, an additional strategy can be implemented. Keys may be updated with probability α, but only if their remaining expiration time is below .This technique requires the ability to read the expiration time. Redis provides the  command for this purpose, while memcache does not. This can be addressed by storing the expiration time alongside the value, for example, packed in JSON.Modifying caching behavior of your system in production is risky, to say the least, so it's safer to apply changes gradually. However, due to the unpredictable nature of the incoming traffic, distinguishing small improvements from noise requires complex data analysis. Development or staging environments proved to be not much better in my cases as they had lower traffic.To tackle this, I used discrete simulation tools for ad-hoc simulations. This approach allowed me to safely test any system behavior I wanted to research much faster than running such experiments in a development environment.While I was composing this article, I compiled numerous code snippets utilized during these experiments into a single tool and made it available through a github repository: https://github.com/whisk/cachestudy.The expiration time extension technique I described in this article shows that improving web application performance doesn’t always require expensive tools or complex changes. By addressing common caching challenges developers can significantly boost efficiency and handle high traffic with simple, cost-effective solutions.\
However, these improvements must be carefully tested in production environments to ensure they work as intended and don’t create new problems. Simulations and pre-production environments often lack the complexity and scale of real-world traffic, and only by testing under actual conditions can you ensure your optimizations provide tangible gains without introducing new issues.Cover image generated by DALL·E.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Space Economy: Trends of Advanced Development</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/new-space-economy-trends-of-advanced-development?source=rss</link><author>NFT Bro</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:51:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
In continuation of the topic raised in the last article, I decided to conduct a study of the space industry development based on the concept of “new space economy”.\
==The new space economy is a global trend based on a number of technological innovations and a certain business model. According to Morgan Stanley, this industry can already be valued at $350 billion and could reach $1 trillion by 2040. This opens up new opportunities for the automotive, tourism, energy, telecommunications, transportation, and other important industries to increase their profitability or improve the structure of work on Earth or in space.==The main prerequisites for my research were:Strong growth of companies and new technological solutions in the space industry;Decreasing cost of transportation to Earth orbit;Growth in the number of spacecraft;The explosive growth of the space economy and its interrelationships with Earth-based industry and economy;Application of industrial and IT innovations to the space industry;Unpredictable revolutionary changes in economic models in the space-Earth nexus (black swans).I have also identified the most promising technologies for the “new space economy” and these are:Spacecraft mass production;Serial production of ultra-light rockets for constellation replenishment and low-orbit launches;Heavy and super-heavy rockets for launching payloads into high orbits and launches to the Moon;High-power autonomous power supply systems (up to 500 kW);Laser communication and navigation systems for long-range communications;Autonomous satellites and rovers;New types of engines, including those that do not require reactive mass or significantly reduce its consumption, allow for constant operation both in low orbits and in space;New materials for various systems (protective, heat dissipating, etc);Electronic component base (including radiation-resistant) increasing computing performance in space (spacecraft, rovers, stations, and in the future on orbital data centers);New types of energy-efficient sensors and systems based on them;Technologies of autonomous production (robotization, additive technologies, AI, new materials processing technologies, etc.).\
Based on this, I conclude the main trends of advanced development.Main trends of advanced development for SpaceTechMultifunctional autonomous heavy platforms and satellites with universal (typified) connectors and data exchange protocols. Unified standards for all satellites and bases for compatibility of various assemblies and designs. Development of the principles of modular construction of satellites (spacecraft) and stations (automated and manned) for space and satellite surfaces. This will provide the unification of technical solutions and the possibility of building complex technical systems without being tied to a country or a manufacturing company.A unified network of communication, navigation, and space traffic control based on AI. Creation of a unified system of space traffic dispatching in the Earth-Moon space with integration of all participants of space exploration programs. ExtraNet is a unified network of data collection, storage, and transmission in space. Extraterritorial principle of access to information, acceleration of data processing for space applications. Verified settlement system using blockchain technologies.==Extraterritoriality of space law, new regulations, and legislation.== ==Freedom of data exchange and settlement in space. Development of the ideology of humanity as a single nation. New principles of governance and cohabitation.==Creation of a new space economy based on goods and services produced in space and their consumption in space. Multiple growth of interaction of Earth industry and economy with space industry and economy.New energy-efficient technologies and solutions adaptable for Earth applications. Biotechnology, new pharmaceuticals, biomaterials printing, photonic processors, superconductivity, magnetic levitation, automated factories and robotic mining systems, robotic shipyards using additive technologies (3D printing of structures and spacecraft in microgravity), autonomous rovers and harvesters.Achieving self-sustainability of space systems. Extraction of minerals and necessary resources for life support systems. Waste recycling technologies and self-sustaining closed ecosystems of bases and stations.Creation of new logistic chains. I mean ==Low orbits / high orbits / geostationary orbits / Lagrange points / Luna using autonomous satellites (tugs)== with long operating times to reduce the cost of transportation. Using AI, creating a network of automatic stations for dispatching and traffic control to reduce accidents (avoiding the Kessler effect). Protection from radiation and space radiation, new alloys (produced in microgravity). Discovery of new chemical elements and compounds and creation of materials with their application.International Space University. Working with the “Big Challenges,” embodiment of the idea of “Mega Science” by taking science and research beyond jurisdictions, hosting on a platform with hosting space infrastructure allows for development trends on interdisciplinarity, openness, and digitalization.  The use of an extraterritorial payment system will make it possible to obtain funding for research outside national institutions. Creation of new training systems for professionals and scientists for the industry through continuously updated digital training programs and practice with real cases.Synergetic revolutionary change of business models of the Earth economy. This will happen with the participation of the space economy. For example, industrial mining of platinum on asteroids will create an economically sound industry of hydrogen transport and hydrogen fuel cells for independent energy supply, which will remove electric transport and wind and solar energy. Another example is hydrocarbon extraction on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, which will increase the Earth's economy by 1000 times.==, we will see the expansion of mankind in the solar system and the expansion of the zone of life.==\
All this will allow us to create completely new technical systems and production directions, as well as significantly expand the capabilities of existing industries.Possible directions of development for Space Tech\
Let's consider possible directions of development.Creation of an infrastructure for access to energy supply anywhere in the solar systemFor this project, all existing energy generation systems will be used, which will complement each other and give impetus to the technological development of autonomous energy supply systems (solar panels, nuclear technologies, energy storage systems).

Typical modules for automated and manned stations in space and on the surface of the Moon will also develop. Then, on the surfaces of satellites and asteroids. Rapid development of all planets and asteroids, with the construction of international settlements.Creation of digital automated diagnostic complexes on the basis of historical datasets on changes in human condition in space, diagnostic techniques, and preventive methods with the application of AI. Development of treatment programs in microgravity conditions. Growing biomaterials in microgravity/bioprinting, operations in microgravity (automated robotic operating complexes, remote control of medical complexes).Unified network of data collection, storage, and transmission outside the EarthThis includes Orbital data centers, data centers on the Moon, and space stations. Radiation-resistant electronic components. Photonic processors.Recent events show that it is time for mankind to go out into the solar system and master it in full. Even already existing technologies are sufficient for the united expansion of mankind into space. Development of asteroids can significantly improve life on Earth (for example, obtaining platinum at the price of aluminum will revolutionize the entire transportation industry, replacing gasoline and diesel with hydrogen) and increase the size of the economy by thousands of times. Establishing full-fledged settlements on other planets and satellites will expand the range of human habitation. The creation of new materials, the development of medicine and pharmaceutics, and the development of new technologies in space will allow us to go further into other star systems.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EU Pledges $200 Billion in AI Spending in Bid To Catch Up With US, China</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/02/11/1617259/eu-pledges-200-billion-in-ai-spending-in-bid-to-catch-up-with-us-china?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:50:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The European Union pledged to mobilize 200 billion euros ($206.15 billion) to invest in AI as the bloc seeks to catch up with the U.S. and China in the race to train the most complex models. From a report: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the bloc wants to supercharge its ability to compete with the U.S. and China in AI. The plan -- dubbed InvestAI -- includes a new 20 billion-euro fund for so-called AI gigafactories, facilities that rely on powerful chips to train the most complex AI models. "We want Europe to be one of the leading AI continents, and this means embracing a life where AI is everywhere," von der Leyen said at the AI Action Summit in Paris. 

The announcement underscores efforts from the EU to position itself as a key player in the AI race. The bloc has been lagging behind the U.S. and China since OpenAI's 2022 release of ChatGPT ushered in a spending bonanza. [...] The EU is aiming to establish gigafactories to train the most complex and large AI models. Those facilities will be equipped with roughly 100,000 last-generation AI chips, around four times more than the number installed in the AI factories being set up right now.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump&apos;s funding freeze and smear campaigns: What&apos;s the real cost of cutting USAID? | DW News Desk</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXVdpti1fDE</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/nXVdpti1fDE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:48:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Donald Trump and Elon Musk have taken an axe to the foreign aid agency USAID, freezing its funding and threatening thousands of staff with unemployment.

Markets have expanded into real-world assets (RWAs), perpetual futures, and FX, but the actual experience of trading across these assets is full of friction.\
Traders deal with fragmented liquidity, collateral stuck in staking contracts, and a system that still revolves around USD stablecoins.\
 is fixing this by launching an Integrated DEX with LST & Perp Futures for FX RWAs. By combining liquid staking RWAs with a Perpetual Futures DEX, Cables enables assets like cEUR, cJPY, and cXAU to function as both collateral and tradable instruments, eliminating the inefficiencies of fragmented liquidity.\
Instead of forcing participants to move liquidity across different protocols, Cables connects yield, collateral, and trade execution in a single system—powering the Cables Liquidity Flywheel.\
This self-reinforcing cycle allows the Cables Community to deposit anything, earn yield on anything, and trade or leverage it without friction.\
Cables recently  and , outlining how it will seamlessly integrate RWAs into DeFi 2.0. With a focus on building for the Cables Community—not just users—this next evolution of DeFi puts accessibility, liquidity, and global adoption at the forefront.DeFi Still Feels Like Using a Flip Phone in 2025For all its advancements, DeFi still feels outdated. Traders looking to hedge non-USD currencies, earn yield on real-world assets, or trade multiple markets often end up bouncing between different platforms, waiting on bridges, and converting back to USD just to execute trades.\
Liquidity is scattered across different chains, making it harder to enter and exit positions efficiently. Assets that should be usable in trading are locked in staking contracts, leaving traders to choose between earning passive yield or keeping capital available.\
And for those looking to trade outside the USD-dominated system, choices are limited—most DeFi pairs still revolve around USDT or USDC, forcing FX traders into unnecessary conversions.\
DeFi shouldn’t just be about adding more assets. It should be about making them usable in real markets. That’s where Cables’ launch of its Integrated LST & Perpetual Futures for FX RWAs in one DEX will dominate and show the world what DeFi 2.0 truly means.Cables’ Integrated LST & Perpetual Futures for FX RWAs in One DEXCables Finance is solving this by making liquid staking RWAs a core piece of trading infrastructure. With liquid staking, the Cables Community doesn’t have to choose between earning yield and accessing deep, liquid markets. Assets like cEUR, cJPY, and cXAU remain liquid, earning yield while serving as active collateral on the Cables Perp DEX.\
A trader looking to hedge euro exposure can hold cEUR, collect yield, and use it for leveraged positions at the same time. A gold-backed stable asset like cXAU provides access to a decentralized gold market while acting as collateral.\
Instead of unstaking funds or swapping between isolated liquidity pools, the Cables Community can trade, hedge, and earn in one place.This approach removes unnecessary steps from DeFi trading. Instead of shifting liquidity between staking and active markets, capital can move freely within a single system.Cables Finance: The Trading Desk DeFi Actually NeedsThe future of DeFi isn’t just about adding assets—it’s about making them work for traders. Liquid staking RWAs allow traders to keep assets active while earning yield, removing the trade-offs that exist today.\
Cables Finance combines deep liquidity with perpetual futures, creating a trading system where RWAs aren’t just passive holdings—they’re part of an active, high-volume market. Instead of treating RWAs as an afterthought, Cables puts them at the core of DeFi 2.0 trading.\
DeFi has spent years making assets tradable. Now, Cables Finance is making trading better—with a Liquidity Flywheel that connects deposit, yield, and leverage in one system.DeFi 2.0 is here. The Cables Community is building it.:::tip

Employees whose review merited a bonus will still get one, and staff will still receive stock awards as part of the upcoming vesting cycle later this month, the people said. 

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg told employees that Meta would cut 5% of its workforce -- as many 3,600 people -- with a focus on staff who "aren't meeting expectations," Bloomberg News first reported in mid-January. Affected US-based employees would be notified on Feb. 10, while international employees could learn later, Zuckerberg said last month. In a separate message to managers, the Facebook co-founder said the cuts would create headcount for the company to hire the "strongest talent."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The HackerNoon Newsletter: AI Coding Tools Are Still in the RD Stage (2/11/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/2-11-2025-newsletter?source=rss</link><author>Noonification</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:05:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🪐 What’s happening in tech today, February 11, 2025?By @andrei9735 [ 7 Min read ] In this post well continue working on link prediction with the Twitch dataset.

: This contribution draws attention to implications connected with meta-architectural design decisions for intelligent tutoring systems in the context of formative assessments. As a first result of addressing this issue, this contribution presents a meta-architectural system design that includes the role of educators.According to an ongoing systematic literature review and similar reviews that have already been conducted [1–3], we see evidence that intelligent tutoring systems are developed from a conceptual perspective in a black-box manner for the actual participants of educational assessment scenarios.\
This emphasizes the necessity to examine system designs, employed algorithms, and the conceptual implementation of pedagogical-psychological models in intelligent tutoring systems to enhance explainability and transparency for all stakeholders. A first step to do so is to reflect on intelligent tutoring systems beyond their current borders and to question:\
RQ1: How can we incorporate the role of educators into meta-architectural designs of intelligent tutoring systems to foster their explainability and transparency?Competency-based learning (or competency-based education and related synonyms as discussed in [4]) refers to a pedagogical approach that supports the development of practical skills and behaviors that are necessary for success in real-world situations [5, 6]. A revised definition of competency-based learning distinguishes this concept into seven major aspects [6, 7]. Two of these aspects address the assessment of competencies: "…(2) assessment is meaningful, timely, relevant, and actionable evidence; … (4) students’ assessment is based on evidence of mastery; [6, p.1904]"(retrieved from Levine & Patrick [7]).\
Formative assessments are a major form of assessing competencies [8–11]. Usually, these kinds of assessments are typically incremental [9, 10, 12] and inform not only learners about their current state but also educators about the effectiveness of their pedagogical and didactical methods [11]. To design, develop, and implement formative assessments, various methodologies have been developed to derive these information for educators, for example, the ADDIE Model [13], Four – Component Instructional Design (4C/ID) [14] or the Evidence Centered-Design Framework (ECD) [15].\
The ECD is based on the idea that when learners fulfill tasks, they create some kind of result (work product) that incorporates, to some degree, the learner’s competence level [16]. Hence, extracting evidence from the work products within a defined evidence identification process leads to claims about certain competencies [15, 17, 18]. Collecting and storing these beliefs result in an individual description of each learner, a learner model. Thus, before constructing the actual assessment, it is necessary to reflect on all those stated parts and other aspects as well [15].\
Educators usually act in a similar (but far less formal) way to develop and apply formative assessments in their educational settings, which costs them a lot of time. A recent McKinsey study ([19]) with a focus on K-12 teachers in the US, UK, CA, and SG reveals that they spend 34% of their time on preparation, evaluation, and feedback tasks [19, 20].\
Hence, researchers and developers have been eager to tailor computer-based learning experiences to the learner´s needs by using evidence about competencies to adapt the learning process autonomously [21– 23]. To achieve this, such systems incorporate learner models, task (or more general domain) models, and automated evidence identification processes and use those to generate adaption recommendations. Examples of conceptional formulations for such systems could be recommending the next best-fitting learning object (e.g., a task with a specific difficulty), finding a sequence of novel courses, or supporting the search for learning peers [24, 25].\
Nowadays, advanced systems are able to mimic the behaviors of human tutors by using artificial intelligence, which results in their classification as intelligent tutoring systems [26, 27]. To do so, these systems not only incorporate learner models and domain models but also so-called tutor models. The tutor model is the decision entity that schedules pedagogical or didactical interventions according to the state of the learner model as a response to the learner’s interaction [28]. As a result of this perspective, intelligent tutoring systems are designed and developed according to the meta-architectural approach illustrated by the gray elements in Figure 1 (see [26, 28–30]).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intel&apos;s Battlemage Architecture</title><link>https://chipsandcheese.com/p/intels-battlemage-architecture</link><author>ksec</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:00:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Intel’s Alchemist architecture gave the company a foot in the door to the high performance graphics segment. The Arc A770 proved to be a competent first effort, able to run many games with credible performance. Now, Intel is passing the torch to a new graphics architecture, named Battlemage.Like Alchemist, Battlemage targets the midrange segment. It doesn’t try to compete with AMD or Nvidia’s high end cards. While it’s not as flashy as Nvidia’s RTX 4090 or AMD’s RX 7900 XTX, midrange GPUs account for a much larger share of the discrete GPU market, thanks to their lower prices. Unfortunately, today’s midrange cards like the RTX 4060 and RX 7600 only come with 8 GB of VRAM, and are poor value. Intel takes advantage of this by launching the Arc B580 at $250, undercutting both competitors while offering 12 GB of VRAM.For B580 to be successful, its new Battlemage architecture has to execute well across a variety of graphics workloads. Intel has made numerous improvements over Alchemist, aiming to achieve better performance with less compute power and less memory bandwidth. I’ll be looking at the Arc B580, with comparison data from the A770 and A750, as well as scattered data I have lying around.Battlemage is organized much like its predecessor. Xe Cores continue to act as a basic building block. Four Xe Cores are grouped into a Render Slice, which also contains render backends, a rasterizer, and associated caches for those fixed function units. The entire GPU shares an 18 MB L2 cache.The Arc B580 overall is a smaller GPU than its outgoing Alchemist predecessors. B580 has five Render Slices to A770’s eight. In total, B580 has 2560 FP32 lanes to A770’s 4096.Battlemage launches with a smaller memory subsystem too. The B580 has a 192-bit GDDR6 bus running at 19 GT/s, giving it 456 GB/s of theoretical bandwidth. A770 has 560 GB/s of GDDR6 bandwidth, thanks to a 256-bit bus running at 17.5 GT/s.Even the host interface has been cut down. B580 only has a PCIe 4.0 x8 link, while A770 gets a full size x16 one. Intel’s new architecture has a lot of heavy lifting to do if it wants to beat a much larger implementation of its predecessor.Battlemage’s architectural changes start at its Xe Cores. The most substantial changes between the two generations actually debuted on Lunar Lake. Xe Cores are further split into XVEs, or Xe Vector engines. Intel merged pairs of Alchemist XVEs into ones that are twice as wide, completing a transition towards larger execution unit partitions. Xe Core throughput stays the same at 128 FP32 operations per cycle.A shared instruction cache feeds all eight XVEs in a Xe Core. Alchemist had a 96 KB instruction cache, and Battlemage almost certainly has an instruction cache at least as large. Instructions on Intel GPUs are generally 16 bytes long, with a 8 byte compacted form in some cases. A 96 KB instruction cache therefore has a nominal capacity of 6-12K instructions.XVEs form the smallest partition in Intel GPUs. Each XVE tracks up to eight threads, switching between them to hide latency and keep its execution units fed. A 64 KB register file stores thread state, giving each thread up to 8 KB of registers while maintaining maximum occupancy. Giving a register count for Intel GPUs doesn’t really work, because Intel GPU instructions can address the register file with far more flexibility than Nvidia or AMD architectures. Each instruction can specify a vector width, and access a register as small as a single scalar element.Meteor Lake articleBattlemage’s divergence behavior by comparison is intuitive and straightforward. SIMD16 achieves full utilization if groups of 16 threads go the same way. The same applies for SIMD32 and groups of 32 coherent threads. Thus Battlemage is actually more agile than its predecessor when dealing with divergent branches, while enjoying the efficiency advantage of using larger vectors.Like Alchemist, Battlemage executes most math operations down two ports (ALU0, ALU1). ALU0 handles basic FP32 and FP16 operations, while ALU1 handles integer math and less common instructions. Intel’s port layout has parallels to Nvidia’s Turing, which also splits dispatch bandwidth between 16-wide FP32 and INT32 units. A key difference is that Turing uses fixed 32-wide vectors, and keeps both units occupied by feeding them on alternate cycles. Intel can issue instructions of the same type back-to-back, and can select multiple instructions to issue per cycle to different ports.In another similarity to Turing, Battlemage carries forward Alchemist’s “XMX” matrix multiplication units. Intel claims 3-way co-issue, implying XMX is on a separate port. However, VTune only shows multiple pipe active metrics for ALU0+ALU1 and ALU0+XMX. I’ve drawn XMX as a separate port above, but the XMX units could be on ALU1.Gaming workloads tend to use more floating point operations. During compute heavy sections, ALU1 offloads other operations and keeps ALU0 free to deal with floating point math. XeSS exercises the XMX unit, with minimal co-issue alongside vector operations. A generative AI workload shows even less XMX+vector co-issue.As expected for any specialized execution unit, XMX software support is far from guaranteed. Running AI image generation or language models using other frameworks heavily exercises B580’s regular vector units, while leaving the XMX units idle.In microbenchmarks, Intel’s older A770 and A750 can often use their larger shader arrays to achieve higher compute throughput than B580. However, B580 behaves more consistently. Alchemist had trouble with FP32 FMA operations. Battlemage in contrast has no problem getting right up to its theoretical throughput. FP32+INT32 dual issue doesn’t happen perfectly on Battlemage, but it barely happened at all on A750.Each XVE also has a branch port for control flow instructions, and a “send” port that lets the XVE talk with the outside world. Load on these ports is typically low, because GPU programs don’t branch as often as CPU ones, and shared functions accessed through the “send” port won’t have enough throughput to handle all XVEs hitting it at the same time.Battlemage’s memory subsystem has a lot in common with Alchemist’s, and traces its origins to Intel’s integrated graphics architectures over the past decade. XVEs access the memory hierarchy by sending a message to the appropriate shared functional unit. At one point, the entire iGPU was basically the equivalent of a Xe Core, with XVE equivalents acting as basic building blocks. XVEs would access the iGPU’s texture units, caches, and work distribution hardware over a messaging fabric. Intel has since built larger subdivisions, but the terminology remains.Each Xe Core has eight TMUs, or texture samplers in Intel terminology. The samplers have a 32 KB texture cache, and can return 128 bytes/cycle to the XVEs. Battlemage is no different from Alchemist in this respect. But the B580 has less texture bandwidth on tap than its predecessor. Its higher clock speed isn’t enough to compensate for having far fewer Xe Cores.B580 runs at higher clock speeds, which brings down texture cache hit latency too. In clock cycle terms though, Battlemage has nearly identical texture cache hit latency to its predecessor. L2 latency has improved significantly, so missing the texture cache isn’t as bad on Battlemage.Global memory accesses are first cached in a 256 KB block, which serves double duty as Shared Local Memory (SLM). It’s larger than Alchemist and Lunar Lake’s 192 KB L1/SLM block, so Intel has found the transistor budget to keep more data closer to the execution units. Like Lunar Lake, B580 favors SLM over L1 capacity even when a compute kernel doesn’t allocate local memory.Intel may be able to split the L1/SLM block in another way, but a latency test shows exactly the same result regardless of whether I allocate local memory. Testing with Nemes’s Vulkan test suite also shows 96 KB of L1.Global memory access on Battlemage offers lower latency than texture accesses, even though the XVEs have to handle array address generation. With texture accesses, the TMUs do all the address calculations. All the XVEs do is send them a message. L1 data cache latency is similar to Alchemist in clock cycle terms, though again higher clock speeds give B580 an actual latency advantage.Battlemage gets a clock cycle latency reduction too with scalar memory accesses. Intel does not have separate scalar instructions like AMD. But Intel’s GPU ISA lets each instruction specify its SIMD width, and SIMD1 instructions are possible. Intel’s compiler has been carrying out scalar optimizations and opportunistically generating SIMD1 instructions well before Battlemage, but there was no performance difference as far as I could tell. Now there is.On B580, L1 latency for a SIMD1 (scalar) access is about 15 cycles faster than a SIMD16 access. SIMD32 accesses take one extra cycle when microbenchmarking, though that’s because the compiler generates two sets of SIMD16 instructions to calculate addresses across 32 lanes. I also got Intel’s compiler to emit scalar INT32 adds, but those didn’t see improved latency over vector ones. Therefore, the scalar latency improvements almost certainly come from an optimized memory pipeline.SIMD1 instructions also help within the XVEs. Intel doesn’t use a separate scalar register file, but can more flexibly address their vector register file than AMD or Nvidia. Instructions can access individual elements (sub-registers) and read out whatever vector width they want. Intel’s compiler could pack many “scalar registers” into the equivalent of a vector register, economizing register file capacity.L1 can deliver 512 bytes per cycleEven if the L1 can only provide 256 bytes per cycle, that still gives Intel’s Xe Core as much L1 bandwidth as an AMD RDNA WGP, and twice as much L1 bandwidth as an Nvidia Ampere SM. 512 bytes per cycle would let each XVE complete a SIMD16 load every cycle, which is kind of overkill anyway.Battlemage uses the same 256 KB block for L1 cache and SLM. SLM provides an address space local to a group of threads, and acts as a fast software managed scratchpad. In OpenCL, that’s exposed via the local memory type. Everyone likes to call it something different, but for this article I’ll use OpenCL and Intel’s term.Even though both local memory and L1 cache hits are backed by the same physical storage, SLM accesses enjoy better latency. Unlike cache hits, SLM accesses don’t need tag checks or address translation. Accessing Battlemage’s 256 KB block of memory in SLM mode brings latency down to just over 15 ns. It’s faster than doing the same on Alchemist, and is very competitive against recent GPUs from AMD and Nvidia.Alchemist and Battlemage both appear to have 32 atomic ALUs attached to each Xe Core’s SLM unit, much like AMD’s RDNA and Nvidia’s Pascal. Meteor Lake’s Xe-LPG architecture may have half as many atomic ALUs per Xe Core.Battlemage has a two level cache hierarchy like its predecessor and Nvidia’s current GPUs. B580’s 18 MB L2 is slightly larger than A770’s 16 MB L2. A770 divided its L2 into 32 banks, each capable of handling a 64 byte access every cycle. At 2.4 GHz, that’s good for nearly 5 TB/s of bandwidth.Intel didn’t disclose B580’s L2 topology, but a reasonable assumption is that Intel increased bank size from 512 to 768 KB, keeping 4 L2 banks tied to each memory controller. If so, B580’s L2 would have 24 banks and 4.3 TB/s of theoretical bandwidth at 2.85 GHz. Microbenchmarking using Nemes’s Vulkan test gets a decent proportion of that bandwidth. Efficiency is much lower on the older A750, which gets approximately as much bandwidth as B580 despite probably having more theoretical L2 bandwidth on tap.Besides insulating the execution units from slow VRAM, the L2 can act as a point of coherency across the GPU. B580 is pretty fast when bouncing data between threads using global memory, and is faster than its predecessor.With atomic add operations on global memory, Battlemage does fine for a GPU of its size and massively outperforms its predecessor.I’m using INT32 operations, so 86.74 GOPS on the A750 would correspond to 351 GB/s of L2 bandwidth. On the B580, 220.97 GOPS would require 883.9 GB/s. VTune however reports far higher L2 bandwidth on A750. Somehow, A750 sees 1.37 TB/s of L2 bandwidth during the test, or nearly 4x more than it should need.Meteor Lake’s iGPU is a close relative of Alchemist, but its ratio of global atomic add throughput to Xe Core count is similar to Battlemage’s. VTune reports Meteor Lake’s iGPU using more L2 bandwidth than required, but only by a factor of 2x. Curiously, it also shows the expected bandwidth coming off the XVEs. I wonder if something in Intel’s cross-GPU interconnect didn’t scale well with bigger GPUs.With Battlemage, atomics are broken out into a separate category and aren’t reported as regular L2 bandwidth. VTune indicates atomics are passed through the load/store unit to L2 without any inflation. Furthermore, the L2 was only 79.6% busy, suggesting there’s a bit of headroom at that layer.sometimes use global atomic operationsB580 has a 192-bit GDDR6 VRAM subsystem, likely configured as six 2×16-bit memory controllers. Latency from OpenCL is higher than it was in the previous generation.I suspect this only applies to OpenCL, because latency from Vulkan (with Nemes’s test) shows just over 300 ns of latency. Latency at large test sizes will likely run into TLB misses, and I suspect Intel is using different page sizes for different APIs.Nvidia’s RTX 4060Intel’s balance of cache capacity and memory bandwidth seems to work well, at least in the few examples I checked. Even when VRAM bandwidth demands are high, the 18 MB L2 is able to catch enough traffic to avoid pushing GDDR6 bandwidth limits. If Intel hypothetically used a smaller GDDR6 memory subsystem like Nvidia’s RTX 4060, B580 would need a larger cache to avoid reaching VRAM bandwidth limits.Probably as a cost cutting measure, B580 has a narrower PCIe link than its predecessor. Still, a x8 Gen 4 link provides as much theoretical bandwidth as a x16 Gen 3 one. Testing with OpenCL doesn’t get close to theoretical bandwidth, but B580 is at a disadvantage compared to A750.often has minimal impact on gaming performanceDCS for example will uses over 12 GB of VRAM with mods. Observing different aircraft in different areas often causes stutters on the B580. VTune shows high PCIe traffic as the GPU must frequently read from host memory. Battlemage retains Alchemist’s high level goals and foundation, but makes a laundry list of improvements. Compute is easier to utilize, cache latency improves, and weird scaling issues with global memory atomics have been resolved. Intel has made some surprising optimizations too, like reducing scalar memory access latency. The result is impressive, with Arc B580 easily outperforming the outgoing A770 despite lagging in nearly every on-paper specification.Some of Intel’s GPU architecture changes nudge it a bit closer to AMD and Nvidia’s designs. Intel’s compiler often prefers SIMD32, a mode that AMD often chooses for compute code or vertex shaders, and one that Nvidia exclusively uses. SIMD1 optimizations create parallels to AMD’s scalar unit or Nvidia’s uniform datapath. Battlemage’s memory subsystem emphasizes caching more than its predecessor, while relying less on high VRAM bandwidth. AMD’s RDNA 2 and Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace made similar moves with their memory subsystems.Of course Battlemage is still a very different animal from its discrete GPU competitors. Even with larger XVEs, Battlemage still uses smaller execution unit partitions than AMD or Nvidia. With SIMD16 support, Intel continues to support shorter vector widths than the competition. Generating SIMD1 instructions gives Intel some degree of scalar optimization, but stops short of having a full-out scalar/uniform datapath like AMD or post-Turing Nvidia. And 18 MB of cache is still less than the 24 or 32 MB in Nvidia and AMD’s midrange cards.Driver overheadBut I hope Intel goes after higher-end GPU segments once they’ve found firmer footing. A third player in the high end dGPU market would be very welcome as many folks are still on Pascal or GCN due to folks feeling as if there is not a reasonable upgrade yet. Intel’s Arc B580 addresses some of that pent-up demand, at least when it’s not out-of-stock. I look forward to seeing Intel’s future GPU efforts.PatreonPayPalDiscord]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The medieval legend of Tristan and Isolde - Iseult Gillespie</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgifhh4pQ10</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Kgifhh4pQ10?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:00:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dig into the tragic myth of Tristan and Princess Isolde, and how they fall in love despite her being promised to another.

We'll choose the 'neptune_ml' profile when we create the data export task and the utility will create the 'training-data-configuration.json' file that we'll use later in the pipeline. The exported data will be ready for feature encoding and data processing, which is the next step required for link prediction.We start with the graph data that we have in Neptune DB after uploading the lists of vertices and edges using the Neptune Bulk Loader API (as described in Part 1 of this guide).\
The vertices represent users. All vertices contain the same set of properties, and a single vertex looks like this:{<T.id: 1>: '153', <T.label: 4>: 'user', 'days': 1629, 'mature': True, 'views': 3615, 'partner': False}
\
All edges have the same label ('follows'), each edge connects 2 users. A single edge looks like this:{<T.id: 1>: '0', <T.label: 4>: 'follows', <Direction.IN: 'IN'>: {<T.id: 1>: '255', <T.label: 4>: 'user'}, <Direction.OUT: 'OUT'>: {<T.id: 1>: '6194', <T.label: 4>: 'user'}}
\
Our goal is to export the data so that it can be used in the next part of our data pipeline: preprocessing and feature encoding.RUNNING THE NEPTUNE-EXPORT UTILITY ON EC2We'll use the  utility provided by AWS to export data from the database. To allow the utility access to the DB, we'll run it on an EC2 instance inside the VPC where the Neptune DB cluster is. The utility will get the data from the DB, save it in local storage (an EBS volume), and then it will upload the exported data to S3.\
Although AWS provides a Cloudformation template that deploys a private API inside your VPC to allow the export process to be started with an HTTP request, we won't focus on that this time. As our goal is to demonstrate how the data pipeline works (and not to set up an API), we'll just use the EC2 instance's console to interact with the neptune-export utility. By the way, those console commands can be automated with AWS Systems Manager Run Command and Step Functions.\
Let's create the EC2 instance that we'll run neptune-export on. For AMI, we choose Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. We need to make sure that the Neptune cluster is reachable from the EC2 instance, so we'll create the instance in the same VPC where the Neptune cluster is, and we'll configure the security groups to allow network traffic between the instance and the cluster. We also need to attach an EBS volume of sufficient size to contain the exported data. For the dataset that we're working on, an 8GB volume is enough.\
While the instance is starting, we need to create an IAM role that allows write access to the destination S3 bucket, and also some RDS actions, as it is shown in the policy below. While the first statement of the policy is mandatory, the second one is only needed if you export data from a cloned cluster. Exporting data from cloned clusters will be be discussed later in this post.{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "RequiredPart",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rds:ListTagsForResource",
                "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
                "rds:DescribeDBClusters"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "OptionalPartOnlyRequiredForExportingFromClonedCluster",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rds:AddTagsToResource",
                "rds:DescribeDBClusters",
                "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
                "rds:ListTagsForResource",
                "rds:DescribeDBClusterParameters",
                "rds:DescribeDBParameters",
                "rds:ModifyDBParameterGroup",
                "rds:ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup",
                "rds:RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime",
                "rds:DeleteDBInstance",
                "rds:DeleteDBClusterParameterGroup",
                "rds:DeleteDBParameterGroup",
                "rds:DeleteDBCluster",
                "rds:CreateDBInstance",
                "rds:CreateDBClusterParameterGroup",
                "rds:CreateDBParameterGroup"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
You can allow access to just the target cluster (instead of all clusters) by editing the ‘Resource’ field.\
The role must also have a trust policy that allows EC2 to assume the role:{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
Once the EC2 instance and the role is ready, we'll attach the role to the instance.\
Next, we need to install the neptune-export utility on the instance. To do that, we’ll log into the instance and use these commands to install JDK 8 and download the utility:sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y openjdk-8-jdk
curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-neptune-customer-samples/neptune-export/bin/neptune-export.jar
Now that we've prepared the EC2 instance, the destination S3 bucket, and attached the IAM the role that allows write access to the destination S3 bucket to the instance, we can start exporting data. We'll use this command to initiate the process, providing the required parameters as a JSON object:java -jar /home/ubuntu/neptune-export.jar nesvc \
  --root-path /home/ubuntu/neptune-export \
  --json '{
    "command": "export-pg",
    "outputS3Path" : "s3://YOUR_TARGET_S3_BUCKET/neptune-export",
    "params": {
       "endpoint" : "YOUR_CLUSTER_ENDPOINT",
       "profile": "neptune_ml"
    }
  }'
We used only the required parameters here but you can easily extend the config. You can choose what part of the graph you export using the 'filter' parameter: you can select nodes, edges, and their properties.\
If you're exporting data from a live database, you can use the '' and '' parameters to make the neptue-export utility take a snapshot of the database, create a new Neptune cluster from that snapshot, deploy read replicas, and use them to export the data. By doing that, you can make sure the live database is not affected by the additional load from the data exporting.VIEWING EXPORTED DATA AND NEXT STEPSWhen the export process is completed, neptune-export prints some stats including the numbers of vertices and edges:Source:
  Nodes: 7126
  Edges: 70648
Export:
  Nodes: 7126
  Edges: 70648
  Properties: 28504
Details:
  Nodes: 
    user: 7126
        |_ days {propertyCount=7126, minCardinality=1, maxCardinality=1, recordCount=7126, dataTypeCounts=[Integer:7126]}
        |_ mature {propertyCount=7126, minCardinality=1, maxCardinality=1, recordCount=7126, dataTypeCounts=[Boolean:7126]}
        |_ views {propertyCount=7126, minCardinality=1, maxCardinality=1, recordCount=7126, dataTypeCounts=[Integer:7126]}
        |_ partner {propertyCount=7126, minCardinality=1, maxCardinality=1, recordCount=7126, dataTypeCounts=[Boolean:7126]}
  Edges: 
    (user)-follows-(user): 70648
And then it uploads the exported data to S3.\
Let's look at the files that are created in the target S3 bucket:\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
The ‘nodes’ and ‘edges’ directories contain CSV files with the lists of nodes and edges that are similar to what we used in Part 1 when we uploaded data. For large graphs, there are multiple files, but our dataset is small and there's just one file in each directory. There's also the training-data-configuration.json file that we'll edit and use in the next step of our process.\
If you're doing a one time export, now it's safe to delete the EC2 instance and the EBS volume, since only the files in the target S3 bucket will be used in the next step. Otherwise, you can just stop the EC2 instance to avoid getting charged for idle time (you'll still be charged for EBS storage unless you delete it).\
At this point we have the graph data in S3 in the format that can be used in the next step of the process, and we're ready to do feature encoding and data processing, which will be discussed in our next post.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[OC] Systems Programming: Everything is trying to kill you and how to stop it</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1in1t0t/oc_systems_programming_everything_is_trying_to/</link><author>/u/Buzz_Cut</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:55:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi everyone!

Januar gemeinsam nach Los Angeles reisen, wo sie gemeinsam zwei Monate verbringen wollten. Die deutsche Tattoo-Künstlerin Jessica Brösche kennt Nikita aus ihrer Zeit in Berlin und hat sie auch schon mehrfach in den USA besucht. Auch dieses Mal war eigentlich alles in Ordnung: Jessica hatte ein Visum, das bis Mai 2025 gültig wäre. Doch an der Grenze zu den USA ging alles schief. «Plötzlich hiess es, Jessica müsse zur Sicherheitsüberprüfung. Seither habe ich sie nicht mehr gesehen», erzählt Nikita. Das war vor 17 Tagen.Warum man sie festhält, ist nicht klar. Möglicherweise glaube das ICE, Jessica habe beabsichtigt, in den USA zu arbeiten, so Nikita. Dies aufgrund eines Eintrags auf Jessicas Instagram-Profil, das die ICE-Beamten kontrolliert hatten.Familie mit dem Auswärtigen Amt in KontaktJessicas Mutter Birgit Brösche, die in Deutschland lebt, bestätigt gegenüber 20 Minuten den von Nikita geschilderten Sachverhalt: Sie konnte bislang nicht mit ihrer Tochter reden. Die Familie sei aber mit dem deutschen Generalkonsulat in Kontakt und mittlerweile sei auch eine Anwältin eingeschaltet worden.Nach quälend langen Tagen der Ungewissheit, wo ihre Tochter überhaupt gelandet war, wisse man jetzt wenigstens, wo sie sei und dass sie in einem sogenannten Detention Camp der amerikanischen Einwanderungsbehörde ICE festgehalten wird. Untergebracht sei sie in einem Zimmer mit vier anderen Frauen, erzählt Birgit Brösche. Gemäss der ICE-Homepage befindet sich Jessica zurzeit im Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.Gesundheitliche Probleme hat Jessica gemäss ihrer Mutter zwar nicht. «Aber sie ist von Natur aus sehr dünn. Wenn sie nicht genug zu essen bekommt, kann es deshalb schnell problematisch für sie werden», erzählt ihre Mutter.Nikita Lofving und andere Freundinnen haben derweil eine Social-Media-Kampagne zur Freilassung von Jessica gestartet. Sie warnen ausländische Touristen ausdrücklich davor, in die USA zu reisen. «Es ist nicht mehr sicher hier. Jeder kann von der ICE verhaftet werden», sagt eine amerikanische Tiktokerin. Auch die deutsche Tiktokerin Jen_dylan setzt sich für Jessicas Freilassung ein.Vom deutschen Auswärtigen Amt heisst es auf Anfrage von 20 Minuten: «Unsere Kolleginnen und Kollegen am Generalkonsulat Los Angeles stehen zu dem Fall in fortwährendem Kontakt mit den US-amerikanischen Behörden und den Familienangehörigen und bemühen sich um eine Lösung. Wir bitten um Verständnis, dass wir uns aus Gründen des Schutzes der Persönlichkeitsrechte der Betroffenen nicht zu weiteren Details der konsularischen Betreuung äussern können.»Die amerikanische Einwanderungsbehörde ICE hat auf Anfragen von 20 Minuten bislang nicht reagiert.Folgst du schon 20 Minuten auf Whatsapp?Eine Newsübersicht am Morgen und zum Feierabend, überraschende Storys und Breaking News: Abonniere den Whatsapp-Kanal von 20 Minuten und du bekommst regelmässige Updates mit unseren besten Storys direkt auf dein Handy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GNOME 48 Now Allows Grouping Notifications By App</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/GNOME-48-Notifications-App</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:18:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[While the GNOME 48 feature and UI freezes went into effect just a little more than one week ago, a freeze exception was granted for merging support in GNOME Shell for grouping notifications on a per-app basis...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US warns Europe against &quot;significant AI regulation, warning industry could be killed | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scs8eHo7jWg</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/scs8eHo7jWg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 15:15:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US Vice President JD Vance has warned world leaders against "significant regulation" of

For our evaluation, we removed from consideration 487 drives, as they did not meet the criteria to be included. We’ll discuss the criteria we used in the next section of this report. Removing these drives leaves us with 300,633 hard drives to analyze. The table below shows the annualized failure rates for Q4 2024 for this collection of drives.. Seagate 24TB drives (model: ST24000NM002H) arrived in early December. The 1,200 drives filled one Backblaze Vault with no failed drives through the end of Q4. The 24TB Seagate drives join the 20TB Toshiba and 22TB WDC drive models in the 20-plus capacity club as we continue to dramatically increase storage capacity while optimizing existing storage server space.Zero failures for the quarter. Five drive models had zero failures for the quarter starting with the 24TB Seagate drive model noted above. The others are the 4TB HGST (model: HMS5C4040ALE640), the 8TB Seagate (model: ST8000NM000A), the 14TB Seagate (model: ST14000NM000J), and the 16TB Seagate (model: ST16000NM002J). All of the zeroes come with the caveat of having a relatively small number of drives and drive days, but zero failures in a quarter is always a good thing.The 4TB drives are nearly extinct. The 4TB drive count decreased by another 1,774 drives in Q4. (I discussed exactly how we migrate them in more detail if you want to dig in.) The remaining ~4,000 drives should be gone by the end of Q1 2025. They will be replaced by the incoming 20TB, 22TB, and 24TB drives. It should be noted that out of the 4TB drives in operation in Q4, only one failed, so those 20-plus TB drives have a lot to live up to from a failure perspective.The quarterly failure rate is down. The AFR for Q4 dropped from 1.89% in Q3 to 1.35% in Q4. While all drive sizes delivered some improvement from Q3 to Q4, one of the primary drivers is the addition of over 14,000 new 20-plus TB drives. As a group, these drives delivered an AFR of 0.77% for the quarter.We noted earlier we removed 487 drives from consideration when we produced the table above covering Q4 2024. There are two primary reasons we did not consider these drive models.. These are drives of a given model that we monitor and collect Drive Stats data on, but are not considered production drives at this time. For example, drives undergoing certification testing to determine if they are performant enough for our environment are not included in our Drive Stats calculations.Insufficient data points. When we calculate the annualized failure rate for a drive model for a given period of time (quarterly, annual, or lifetime), we want to ensure we have enough data to reliably do so. Therefore we have defined criteria for a drive model to be included in the tables and charts for the specified period of time. Models that do not meet these criteria are not included in the tables and charts for the period in question.Regardless of whether or not a given drive model is included in the charts and tables, all of the data for all of the drives we use is included in our Drive Stats dataset which you can download by visiting our Drive Stats page.As with the Q4 quarterly results, we will apply these criteria to the annual and lifetime charts that follow in this report.2024 annual hard drive failure ratesAs of the end of 2024, Backblaze was monitoring 301,120 hard drives used to store data. We removed nine drive models consisting of 2,012 drives from consideration as they did not meet the annual criteria we have defined. This leaves us with 298,954 drives divided across 27 different drive models. The table below shows the AFRs for 2024 for this collection of drives.. There were no qualifying drive models with zero failures in 2024. That said, the 16TB Seagate (model: ST16000NM002J) got close by recording just one drive failure back in Q3, giving the drive an AFR of 0.22% for 2024. . During 2024, our data center techs installed 53,337 drives. If we assume there are 2,080 work hours a year (52 weeks times 40 hours), that math is , and that means our intrepid DC techs installed 26 drives per hour. Busy, busy, busy! While there were 1,200 new 24TB Seagate drives added in 2024, they were installed in early December and did not accumulate enough drive days to make the cut for the annual, or lifetime, tables. Including the 24TB Seagate drive, there were three models that missed out on being included in the 2024 annual tables, these drive models are listed below.As a reminder, a drive model needs to have over 250 drives by the end of Q4 and accumulate at least 50,000 drive days during 2024 to be included in the annual tables.Comparing Drive Stats for 2022, 2023, and 2024The table below compares the annual failure rates by drive model for each of the last three years. The table includes just those drive models which met the annual criteria as of the end of 2024. The data for each year is inclusive of that year only for the operational drive models present at the end of each year. The table is sorted by drive size and then AFR. The 2024 AFR for all drives listed was 1.57%, this is down from 1.70% in 2023.  We expect the overall failure rates to continue to fall in 2025, but we will be watching the following for indicators.
The failure rates of the 8TB and 12TB drive models. All of the models will exceed their five years of service. In general, the failure rate will noticeably increase as the drives exceed five years of service. And, while there are outliers like the current HGST 4TB drives, you can’t assume that will happen.The failure rates of the 14TB and 16TB drive models. These models are approaching middle age—three to five years in operation. This is where, according to the bathtub curve, their failure rates could gradually increase—but not as severely as when they exceed five years. The failure rates for the 20TB, 22TB, and 24TB drives models. These drives will enter the flat portion of the bathtub curve, that is where their failure rate should be the lowest.Annualized failure rates vs. drive sizeNow, we can dig into the numbers to see what else we can learn. We’ll start by looking at the quarterly annualized failure rate by drive size over the last three years.Let’s take a look at the different drive sizes and how they affect the overall annualized failure rate over time.. The 4TB (blue line) drives and 10TB (gold line) drives have had little impact over the last year on the overall failure rate as each finished the year with a relatively small number of drives. Still, the wild ride delivered by the 10TB drives keeps our DC techs on their toes. . The 8TB (gray line) drives and 12TB (purple line) drives range in age from five to eight years and as such their overall failure rates should be increasing over time. The 12TB drives are following that pattern moving up from about 1% AFR back in 2021 to just about 3% in 2024. The failure rates of the 8TB drives, while erratic from quarter-to-quarter, have a nearly flat trendline over the same period.. The 14TB (green line) and 16TB (azure* line) drives comprise 57% of the drives in service and on average they range in age from two to four years. They are in the prime of their working lives. As such, they should have low and stable failure rates, and as you can see, they do.*  Maybe azure isn’t quite right, but robin’s egg blue seemed a bit pretentious.. The 22TB (orange line) drives are in their early days as we continue to add more drives on a regular basis. Once the drive population settles down, we’ll have a better sense of the AFR direction. Still, the early results are solid with a lifetime AFR of 1.06%.Annualized failure rates vs. manufacturerOne of the more popular ways we can look at this data is by the drive manufacturer as we’ve done below.To complete the picture, the chart below uses the same data, but displays just the linear trendlines for each of the manufacturers over the same three-year period.. While the HGST trendline is not pretty, it doesn’t tell the entire story. Looking at the first chart, until Q4 2023, the HGST drives were at or below the average for all of the drives, that is all manufacturers. At that point, HGST has exceeded the average, and then some. The table below contains results for just the HGST drives for 2024. We’ve sorted them, high to low, by the 2024 AFR.As you can see, there are two 12TB drive models driving the high AFR for the HGST drives. The HUH721212ALN604 model began showing signs of an increased quarterly AFR in Q1 2023 and the HUH721212ALE604 model followed suit in Q3 2024. Without these drive models, the 2024 AFR for HGST drive would be 0.55%.. The quarterly AFR trendline decreased for the Seagate drives from 2022 through 2024. While the decrease was slight, from 2.25% to 2.0%, Seagate was the only manufacturer to do so. The decrease appears, at least in part, to be due to the removal of the Seagate 4TB drives during that period. . Over the 2022 to 2024 period, the quarterly AFR for the Toshiba drive models varied within a fairly narrow range between 0.80% and 1.52%, with most quarters hovering slightly around 1.2%. Most importantly, none of the individual drive models were outliers, as the highest quarterly AFR for any Toshiba drive model was 1.58%. We like consistency. . While WDC drive models delivered a similar level of consistency as the Toshiba models, they did so with a lower AFR each quarter. From 2022 through 2024, the range of quarterly AFR values for the WDC models was 0.0% to 0.85%. The 0.0% AFR was in Q1 2022 when none of the 12,207 WDC drives in operation failed during that quarter.Lifetime hard drive statsAs of the end of 2024, Backblaze was monitoring 301,120 hard drives used to store data. Applying our drive criteria noted above for the lifetime period, we removed 11 drive models consisting of 2,736 drives from consideration as they did not meet the lifetime criteria we defined. This leaves us with 298,230 drives divided across 25 different drive models. The table below shows the lifetime AFRs for this collection of drives.The current lifetime AFR for all of the drives is 1.31%. This is down from 1.46% in 2023. The drop is primarily due to the completion of the migration of the 4TB Seagate drives in 2024, which left us with only two of these drives still in operation as of the end of 2024. As a consequence, the 79 million drive days and over 5,600 drive failures racked up by the 4TB Seagate drives by the end of 2023 are not included in the data presented in the 2024 lifetime table above.  In the final table below, we’ve taken the lifetime table and sorted out the drive models that have a lifetime AFR of 1.50% or less by drive size.A couple of caveats as you review the table.There is enough data for each model to say the AFR values are solid. That said, everything could change tomorrow. In general, the hard drive failure rate follows the bathtub curve as the drives age—unless it doesn’t. Some drives refuse to fail as they age, like the 4TB HGST drives. Other drives are great, and then “hit the wall” and bend the failure curve upward, fast.A drive model with a 1% annualized failure rate means that you can expect one drive out of 100 to fail in a year. If you’re a personal drive user, that one drive could be yours. If you have exactly one drive, your personal annualized failure rate is 100%. In other words, always have a backup, and don’t forget to test it.I have been authoring the various Drive Stats reports for the past ten years and this will be my last one. I am retiring, or perhaps in Drive Stats vernacular, it would be “migrating.” Either way, after 10 years in the U.S. Air Force and 30+ years in Silicon Valley Tech, it is time. Drive Stats will continue with Stephanie Doyle and David Johnson as the replacement drive models beginning with the Q1 2025 report. I wish them well.I want to say thank you to each of you who have taken your time to peruse and engage with the Drive Stats reports and data over the last 10 years. And, thank you as well for the comments, questions, and discussions that raced and raged across the various communities that care about something as mundane and awesome as a hard drive. It has been quite the ride—thanks again.The Hard Drive Stats dataThe complete data set used to create the tables and charts in this report is available on our Hard Drive Test Data page. You can download and use this data for free for your own purpose. All we ask are three things: 1) you cite Backblaze as the source if you use the data, 2) you accept that you are solely responsible for how you use the data, and 3) you do not sell this data itself to anyone; it is free.Good luck, and let us know if you find anything interesting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ubuntu 25.04&apos;s GNOME Web Browser Will Be Able To Play More Web Videos By Default</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ubuntu-Epiphany-Bad-Plugins</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 14:54:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Those making use of the GNOME Web "Epiphany" web browser with the upcoming Ubuntu 25.04 release will be able to enjoy playing more popular web videos thanks to a packaging change...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FOSDEM 2025 - Rust for Linux</title><link>https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6507-rust-for-linux/</link><author>/u/l-const</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 14:53:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rust for Linux is the project adding support for the Rust language to the Linux kernel.This talk will give a high-level overview of the project and will walk its history from the beginning -- it sounds like it was yesterday when we started, but it has been more than 4 years now.How did the endeavor start?

Since then, humans have made use of different kinds of torches to navigate the world at night. From the Egyptians to the Romans, to the Chinese, oil lamps were common in the cities of ancient civilizations. The real boom, however, came with the discovery of electricity, which eventually led to the global grid of artificial lighting we have today. 

But most of life on Earth has evolved to rely only on the light of the moon and the stars at night. Anything brighter than that creates an imbalance that can have deadly consequences. And this isn’t only true for nocturnal creatures. We are also affected by exposure to artificial light and can develop serious conditions because of it, like sleep disorders, diabetes and even cancer.

Today, Canonical announced a 12 year security maintenance and support commitment starting with  Kubernetes 1.32. The new release is easy to install, operate and upgrade, with best-of-breed open source networking, DNS, gateway, metrics server, local storage, load balancer and ingress services. Canonical Kubernetes enables customers to upgrade at their own pace, with new upstream releases every four months for organizations that prefer to move fast, and a 12 year commitment for organizations that need long-term supported environments.“Constant Kubernetes upgrades are a drain on enterprise teams. Customers who deploy Canonical Kubernetes 1.32 LTS can focus on the future, because their clusters will receive security updates for 12 full years,” said Mark Shuttleworth. “Combined with Ubuntu Pro , which covers the widest range of open source applications, the entire open source stack can now be operated with greater confidence and simpler compliance to hardening standards like FedRAMP. From the public cloud to the data center to the edge, on servers and workstations and connected devices, we are excited to deliver a simple ‘deploy-and-move-forward’ approach to enterprise grade containers that keeps the business focus on applications and innovation rather than infrastructure.”Canonical Kubernetes is a multi-cloud distribution that provides a unified production-grade Kubernetes experience for developer workstations, cloud, data centers and edge deployments. Future releases of MicroK8s and Charmed Kubernetes will build on Canonical Kubernetes and also gain the 12 year LTS. Customers will also be able to orchestrate their Kubernetes clusters using standalone Canonical Kubernetes LTS binaries and container images, with full enterprise support from Canonical. Long term support and latest upstream KubernetesThe upstream Kubernetes release cycle is fast-paced, with a new version every four months and security maintenance provided for 14 months. Frequent Kubernetes version upgrades disrupt business continuity and require time-consuming and expensive maintenance. At the same time, the pace of innovation in Kubernetes makes newer versions attractive for developers and new deployments.Canonical will provide interim releases of its Kubernetes packages every four months, aligned with the upstream Kubernetes release cadence and versions. These interim releases will be security maintained and supported for 14 months, with upgrade paths from release to release.Like Ubuntu, Canonical will release LTS packages of Kubernetes every two years, starting with Canonical Kubernetes 1.32 LTS. With an Ubuntu Pro subscription, these LTS releases will get CVE security fixes for at least 12 years. Thereafter, Canonical will continue to support and patch these releases of Kubernetes based on customer needs for extremely long-lived deployments in telecommunications and other critical infrastructure.In this way, Canonical’s packaging and LTS commitment to Kubernetes enables both rapid acquisition of the latest upstream for fast-moving deployments and developers, and long term maintenance for production deployments that need to remain stable for many years. Best-of-breed open sourceCanonical Kubernetes ships with best-of-breed open source components for essential functions and uses only standard Kubernetes abstractions and APIs to achieve full Kubernetes conformance. This enables the platform to evolve to newer implementations with minimal user disruption. Canonical Kubernetes 1.32 LTS will provide Cilium, MetalLB, CoreDNS, OpenEBS and Metrics Server by default. Customers can replace these components in the rare cases they need to do so, and the Canonical-provided elements will still be supported.Canonical will also provide standardized container images of popular Kubernetes ecosystem services such as Istio, Cert Manager or OpenTelemetry Collector – also with a 12 year security and support commitment. Customers can request additional open source components to be added to this Kubernetes ecosystem portfolio through the Everything LTS offering.Easy to install and operate across environmentsDevOps teams often use different Kubernetes distributions or versions across the application development and deployment lifecycle. As workloads move from development to test to production, any difference between those environments is a source of friction, cost, and mistakes.Canonical Kubernetes offers a simple low-touch operational approach across the entire software lifecycle. The same package provides the same APIs on developer workstation environments, small clusters, and even larger, more complex scenarios.For single-node or smaller multi-node clusters, Canonical Kubernetes is installed with just two commands per node. These clusters will automatically update with security-only fixes for the maintenance lifetime of that version, making it an easy solution for both edge and workstation.Canonical Kubernetes can also be orchestrated in more complex environments for custom storage, networking (including Multus for telco requirements) and GPUs for AI/ML training and model serving. It also comes with cluster lifecycle automation through Juju, with the possibility to integrate other Canonical infrastructure stack components.“Canonical Kubernetes Platform offers the freedom to operate Kubernetes your own way,” said Marcin Stożek, Product Manager for Kubernetes at Canonical. “It enables you to choose between automatic cluster upgrades or staying on a long-term supported release for extended stability. By addressing infrastructure complexity – one of Kubernetes’ primary challenges – through reliable security maintenance, lifecycle automation, and additional open-source components, we simplify cloud-native platform operations for all users.”Security maintenance and support for Canonical Kubernetes can be purchased with an Ubuntu Pro subscription.

In Plasma 6.3, KWin makes a stronger effort to snap things to the screen’s pixel grid, greatly reducing blurriness and visual gaps everywhere and producing sharper and crisper images.This works at very high zoom levels as well, as KWin’s Zoom effect switches to a sharp pixel-perfect representation and overlays a grid on top of the screen. You can actually see how individual pixels look relative to other ones. Very useful for artists and designers.In the color department, screen colors are more accurate when using the  feature both with and without ICC profiles, and KWin offers the option to choose screen color accuracy — although this can sometimes affect system performance.A smaller but still nice detail is that widgets placed on the desktop are very slightly translucent, just like the popups of widgets placed on the panel: monitors CPU usage more accurately, and consumes vastly fewer CPU resources while doing it! If you’re using Plasma 6.3 on FreeBSD, you’re in luck: the System Monitor app and widgets can now collect GPU statistics on your system too. also provides more information, exposing data about all of your GPUs as well as your batteries’ cycle counts.Monitoring printers is equally easy, as each printer’s print queue is shown directly in the widget. The widget also shows a little spinner on any printers that are currently printing, so you can see at a glance which ones are in use.Plasma already includes a variety of background services that let you know when something has gone wrong and what to do about it. New in Plasma 6.3 is a service that detects when the kernel terminated an app because the system ran out of memory. The service shows a notification explaining what happened, and suggests ways of avoiding this issue in the future.Moving on to specific tools, Plasma 6.3’s  (the built-in search tool that also does conversions, calculations, definitions, graph plotting, and much more),  (Plasma’s software management/app store application), and the  widget all come with new features and improvements:KRunner and KRunner-powered searches now let you jump between categories using the / keys and +/+ key combinations.A security enhancement landing in Discover highlights sandboxed apps whose permissions will change after being updated. This allows you to check on such changes in case you suspect any shady behavior.In a similar vein, you can now see whether apps are packaged directly by their developer, or verified by a trusted third party.If you’re a fan of the forecasts provided by Deutscher Wetterdienst, you’re in luck: Plasma 6.3’s weather widget allows using this source for weather data.Plasma 6.3 makes things easy without ditching flexibility. If you prefer using a mouse with your laptop, you can now configure its built-in touchpad to switch off automatically, so it doesn’t interfere with your typing. Also, if you set up your machine as a network hotspot, Plasma generates a random password for the network so you don’t have to think one up.Finding help is easier in Plasma 6.3. A “Help” category has been added to the launcher (the menu that tends to live on the left hand side of your panel), and we have removed the  category entirely. Its contents have been merged into the  category, reducing the number of categories that don’t offer meaningful grouping.Speaking of menus, the default  launcher menu now switches categories only when you click on them, matching the behavior of all other sidebar lists. However, if you preferred the old switch-on-hover behavior, it’s still available too.We have made things clearer by adding a  item to the desktop context menu for symbolic links, the digital Clock widget displays all events on days with more than five of them (giving you a complete view of upcoming commitments), and when you want to reboot into the bootloader menu the next time your machine reboots, the logout screen now indicates this.To avoid overwhelming you with too much information, when notifications arrive while Plasma’s “Do Not Disturb” mode is engaged, exiting that mode shows the number of missed notifications, rather than sending them all in one giant torrent.Additionally, a subtle but important change: when you drag a file out of a window that’s partially below other windows, it no longer jumps to the top, potentially obscuring what you wanted to drag it into!Finally, what would Plasma be without customization? To begin with, panels can be cloned! You can also use scripting to change your panels’ opacity levels and what screen they appear on.In Plasma 6.2, we introduced symbolic icons in ’s category sidebar. Some people didn’t like that, so in 6.3 you can undo the change yourself: we modified the implementation to pull icons from the standard data source, allowing you to set them to whatever you want using the  app.Speaking of the  app, editing desktop files for apps from the “Edit Application…” menu item in  (and other launcher menus) opens the app in the editor, rather than showing you file properties. This lets you easily edit the entire applications list!If you have ever lost a widget in the process of customizing your system, you’ll love this new feature: in Plasma 6.3, the  gives you the opportunity to remove every instance of a widget, including those that got lost or are only present on unplugged screens.…and there’s much more.

Vance that punishing tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum will hurt his home state of Ohio, a senior Canadian official said. The two leaders met on the sidelines of an international summit in Paris, as the Trump administration moves forward with its threat to impose 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, including from its biggest supplier, Canada, effective March 12."Tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum would be entirely unjustified," Trudeau told reporters at the summit. "We are the [U.S.'s] closest ally. Our economies are integrated."Trump said on Monday the tariffs would be imposed on steel and aluminum from all countries "without exceptions or exemptions."The federal government will work with the Trump administration over the coming weeks, Trudeau said, to make sure it understands the impact the levies would have on both the U.S. and Canada.When asked by CBC News if he would reciprocate with matching tariffs on aluminum and steel, Trudeau said he hopes that doesn't have to happen. "If it comes to that, our response, of course, will be firm and clear. We will stand up for Canadian workers. We will stand up for Canadian industries."WATCH | Tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum 'entirely unjustified,' PM says:Trump is promising to revive U.S. steelmaking in Rust Belt states, including Ohio, to bring back more industrial manufacturing jobs. Trudeau mentioned the impact of tariffs on Ohio to Vance, a Canadian official said. The state is America's biggest exporter sending more than $21 billion US in goods to Canada in 2023, according to the U.S. Trade Representative. If Canada retaliates, its steel, cars, plastics, iron and plane exports could be hit with counter tariffs.The prime minister didn't announce specific retaliatory measures on Tuesday, but his government has warned that a trade war could drive up consumer prices and hurt the economy south of the border.WATCH | Trump imposes 25% tariff on all steel, aluminum imports:The prime minister made his comments in Paris, on his way to the AI Action Summit hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Vance didn't respond to Canadian media's questions about the tariffs while arriving at the summit on Tuesday. The prime minister said he is also working with international leaders to co-ordinate a response and will be travelling to Brussels on Wednesday to meet with European Union leaders and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. Experts say new tariffs may have more of an impact than in Trump's first term:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rendering React on Golang with V8Go</title><link>https://itnext.io/rendering-react-on-golang-with-v8go-fd84cdad2844?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=040bff7b0a2ca9d02179c7897476ace4</link><author>/u/congolomera</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 13:03:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Server-side rendering (SSR) is essential for improving web performance, SEO, and initial page load experience.

DESCRIPTION
Kent Beck and Daniel Terhorst-North reflect on the evolution of Extreme Programming (XP) and its lasting impact on agile software development. They explore the importance of short feedback loops, iterative learning, and adaptability in different phases of product development, as outlined in Beck’s 3X model (Exploration, Expansion, Extraction).

Kent introduces radical techniques like Test && Commit || Revert (TCR) and Limbo, which challenge traditional coding and collaboration practices by emphasizing tiny, safe iterations. The conversation ties in psychological safety, a key factor in high-performing teams, as outlined by Amy C. Edmondson.

Kent envisions a future where software development scales in real-time, pushing teams to embrace faster experimentation, responsibility, and continuous learning in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. [...]

In 2021, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, avian flu began aggressively circulating in wildlife. Dead and sick birds began showing up on shorelines. Poultry farms were forced to cull millions of animals, often in horrific ways, to help stop the spread. Egg prices skyrocketed. Farmers lost millions of dollars. The problem doesn’t stop with birds; avian flu has also been found in a wide range of mammals. More than 24,000 sea lions in South America have reportedly died from it. Then, on January 6, 2025, the US reported the first human death. It’s an alarming development, but fortunately an outlier. The truth is avian flu still poses little threat to humans. But if we’re not worried now, when should we be?

The bill expired in September 2023 without being used.The legislation was akin to the World War II Lend-Lease Act, in which equipment is supplied at no cost and is to be used until returned or destroyed. As questions hang over U.S. aid for Ukraine, a new lend-lease deal could give Kyiv weapons without drawing on American taxpayer dollars.On Monday, Wilson announced on X, formerly Twitter, that he would introduce the first lend-lease act to give President Donald Trump the authority to arm Ukraine against Russia.However, Ukrainian diplomats have been lobbying for its reintroduction as it would allow the U.S. president to loan or lease arms to Ukraine while cutting through congressional red tape.Wilson, who chairs the U.S. Helsinki Commission and the National Security and Foreign Affairs Task Force, wrote that he would introduce the Freedom First Lend-Lease Act to "give President Trump flexible authorities to send war-winning weapons to our partners including Ukraine."The representative said the move could help bring Russia "to the table through American strength."U.S. weapons approved for supply by former President Joe Biden are still being supplied to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told Reuters.However, amid speculation over Washington's military aid for Ukraine, the Trump administration intends to get allies in Europe to start buying American weapons for Ukraine, the news agency reported.In a statement to , Ukrainian human rights lawyer Oleksandra Matviichuk, who heads the Center for Civil Liberties in Kyiv, said the congressional leaders she met with last week had showed "unwavering solidarity and support" for Ukraine.She added: "They understand the existential fight that we as Ukrainians face. We are on the frontlines in fighting for democracy and freedom, which makes our world safer."U.S. Representative Joe Wilson: "Today, I will introduce the FREEDOM FIRST LEND-LEASE ACT to give President Trump flexible authorities to send war-winning weapons to our partners including Ukraine to deter War Criminal Putin as Biden should have done long ago. Bring Russia to the table through American Strength!"Oleksandra Matviichuk, a Ukrainian human rights lawyer, told : "In speaking with my American colleagues and U.S. congressional leaders like Rep. Joe Wilson, I'm always overcome by their unwavering solidarity and support. They understand the existential fight that we as Ukrainians face."Details of the bill and whether it has the backing of other members of Congress remain unclear.It is also unclear if the U.S. plans to ask European countries to purchase American arms through commercial contracts or from the American stockpile.Unnamed sources told Reuters that Kellogg would discuss the issue at the Munich Security Conference, which begins on Friday, as the Trump administration looks at how to continue supplying Ukraine without incurring large costs.Update 2/11/25, 7:31 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with comment from Oleksandra Matviichuk.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Sherman Tanks could BEAT Tiger Tanks</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t7ZIZcQy_0</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-t7ZIZcQy_0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Migrating a Ray-Tracing Calculator from C to Rust – Planning a Master’s Thesis &amp; Looking for Advice (C, Rust, BSP-Tree)</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1imws36/migrating_a_raytracing_calculator_from_c_to_rust/</link><author>/u/Smil3More</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 11:48:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I am planning a  in which I need to modernize and parallelize an existing scientific C program for electromagnetic wave propagation calculation/simulation.

One of the main differences between v3 and its v2 predecessor is that the new UI is written in WebAssembly (WASM) using Go. At first glance, this might seem an odd choice - Go typically isn't the first language you think of when deciding to program a Web UI - but we had good reasons. In this blog post, I'll explain why we chose WebAssembly, some of our implementation challenges (and how we worked around them), and the results.Two Codebases = More Work, Fewer FeaturesDagger works by building up a DAG of operations and evaluating them, often in parallel. By nature, this is a difficult thing to display. To help users make sense of it, we offer two real-time visualization interfaces: the Dagger terminal UI (TUI), included in the Dagger CLI, and Dagger Cloud, an online Web dashboard. The Dagger TUI is implemented in Go, and Dagger Cloud (pre-v3) was written in React.Obviously, we want both user interfaces to be as close to each other as possible. But the actual act of interpreting Dagger's event stream in real-time and producing a UI is pretty involved. Some of the more complex event streams we've seen have hundreds of thousands of OpenTelemetry spans, and managing the data structures around them gets very complicated, very quickly. The Web UI often couldn't keep up with the huge volume of data it had to process and it would become laggy and slow; to fix this performance bottleneck, we were forced into a different implementation model for the React application.So, we ended up with two interfaces trying to accomplish the same thing, one of them in one language and ecosystem (TypeScript/React), the other in a totally different language and ecosystem (Go), and we couldn't easily share business logic between them. As a small team, we need to ship fast. Having to re-implement every feature twice was just a massive tax on our velocity.We started thinking about a new approach to Dagger Cloud, with two main goals:Unify the codebases, to eliminate duplication and make it more efficient to ship new featuresDeliver on the promise of a crisp, snappy Web UI, matching the speed and performance of the terminal UIChoosing Go + WebAssemblyOur starting goal was to be able to reuse one codebase for both Dagger Cloud and the TUI. We decided fairly early to make it a Go codebase. Technically, we could have gone the other way and used TypeScript for the TUI. But we're primarily a team of Go engineers, so selecting Go made it easier for others in the team to contribute, to add a feature or drop in for a few hours to help debug an issue. In addition to standardizing on a single language, it gave us flexibility and broke down silos in our team.Once we decided to run Go code directly in the browser, WebAssembly was the logical next step. But there were still a couple of challenges:The Go + WebAssembly combination is still not as mature as React and other JavaScript frameworks. There are no ready-made component libraries to pull from, the developer tooling isn't as rich, and so on. We knew that we would need to build most of our UI components from scratch.There is a hard 2 GB memory limit for WebAssembly applications in most browsers. We expected this to be a problem when viewing large traces, and we knew we would have to do a lot of optimization to minimize memory usage and keep the UI stable. This wasn't entirely bad though; the silver lining here was that any memory usage improvements made to the WebAssembly UI would also benefit TUI users, since it was now a shared codebase.Once we'd made the decision, the next question was, "how do we build this?" We decided to build the new WebAssembly-based UI in the Go-app framework. Go-app is a high-level framework specifically for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in WebAssembly. It offers key Go benefits, like fast compilation and native static typing, and it also follows a component-based UI model, like React, which made the transition easier.Since the Go + WebAssembly combination isn't mainstream, there was some healthy skepticism within the Dagger team about its feasibility. For example, there was no real ecosystem for Go-app UI components and we knew we’d have to write our own, but we weren’t sure how easy or difficult this would be. We also had concerns over integrations with other services (Tailwind, Auth0, Intercom, PostHog), and about rendering many hundreds of live-updating components at the same time. To answer these questions and de-risk the project, I spent almost a month prototyping, with the goal of re-implementing as much of the existing UI as possible in Go-app. As it turned out, there weren't many blockers: WebAssembly is already a well-documented open standard and most other questions were answered in Go-app’s own documentation. The biggest challenge, as expected, was the memory usage limit, which required careful design and optimization.From Prototype to ProductionOnce we had a working proof of concept, the team's comfort level increased significantly and we kicked off project "awesome wasm" to deliver a production implementation. Here are a few notes from the journey:Memory usage was easily the most existential threat to the project’s success. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to render 200k+ lines of log output without crashing. This led to optimizations deep in our virtual terminal rendering library, which dramatically reduced TUI memory usage at the same time (as mentioned already, sharing codebases means that important optimizations in one interface become "free" in the other!)Go WASM is slow at parsing large amounts of JSON, which led to dramatic architecture changes and the creation of a “smart backend” for incremental data loading over WebSockets, using Go's rarely-used encoding/gob format.Initially, the WASM file was around 32 MB. By applying Brotli compression, we were able to bring it down to around 4.6 MB. We tried to perform Brotli compression on-the-fly in our CDN but the file was too large, so eventually we just included the compression step into our build process.Apart from the memory challenges, most of our other initial worries turned out unfounded. The UI components weren’t very hard to write, integrations with other services were straightforward, and I found good techniques for handling component updates in real-time.There were a number of useful NPM packages I found, so I wondered if I could use them with Go. WebAssembly has a straightforward interface to both Go and JavaScript, so I built a Dagger module that uses Browserify to load an NPM package. This module allows us to generate a JavaScript file that can be included in a Go application. This means that we can work primarily in Go and then, if needed, we have a way to load helpers that are implemented in native JavaScript.Disclaimer: I'm not a React professional so with that in mind...it seemed to me that React had a very rigid way of implementing components, while Go-app was much more flexible. In Go-app, you can have any component update whenever you like, which gives you many more degrees of freedom for optimization. For example, I needed to optimize a component rendering 150,000+ lines of output. Just having the ability to try different approaches and then pick the one that worked best, made the entire exercise much easier!Even though Go-app doesn't have React-like developer tools built into the browser, I was able to use Go's own tools (pprof) plus the default profiler built into the browser for profiling and debugging. This was very useful to inspect functions calls, track CPU and memory usage, and evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches for optimizing memory usage.I discovered a side benefit of using Go-app: since Dagger Cloud is built as a PWA, it can be installed as a desktop or a mobile application. This makes it possible to launch Dagger Cloud like a native application and get a full-screen experience without needing to open a browser first, or just have a dedicated icon in your desktop taskbar/dock.We soft-launched Dagger Cloud v3 to our Dagger Commanders a few weeks ago to collect feedback and made it available to everyone shortly thereafter.Our switch from React to WASM has resulted in a more consistent user experience across all Dagger interfaces, and better overall performance and lower memory usage, especially when rendering large and complex traces.From an engineering perspective too, the benefits to our team are significant. Optimizations very often involve just as much, if not more, work than actually implementing features. So it's great to not have to spend time optimizing the Web UI, and then more time optimizing the TUI, and instead actually focus on delivering new features.Dagger Cloud v3 has the Dagger community buzzing and one of the more common questions we've been fielding recently is: who should consider doing this and who shouldn't?We want to be clear that we're not generally recommending making front-ends in Go. We had some very good reasons to do it: a team of strong Go engineers; a complex UI that TypeScript/React didn't scale well for; a requirement for standardization and reuse between two codebases; and a company-wide mandate to increase our velocity. That's a fairly specific set of circumstances. If you're in similar circumstances, this is certainly an option worth evaluating; if not, there are other tools and standards that you should consider first.Dagger Cloud v3 is still in beta and we're excited for you to try it out. If you'd like to know more about our implementation or simply have feedback to share on the new UI, join our Discord and let us know what you think!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JD Vance criticises EU’s ‘excessive’ regulation of tech as he addresses Paris AI summit</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/11/europe-live-paris-ai-action-summit-macron-von-der-leyen-jd-vance-tariffs?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;amp;page=with%3Ablock-67ab1d1b8f0807c383877261#block-67ab1d1b8f0807c383877261</link><author>/u/senseibarbosa</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 10:15:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LangChain and Agentic AI Engineering with Erick Friis</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/02/11/langchain-and-agentic-ai-engineering-with-erick-friis/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=langchain-and-agentic-ai-engineering-with-erick-friis</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED4262555283.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 10:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[LangChain is a popular open-source framework to build applications that integrate LLMs with external data sources like APIs, databases, or custom knowledge bases.

This article explores why context-switching is so costly and how to manage it effectively.Authorization can significantly impact your application’s security and scalability. From managing dynamic permissions to implementing fine-grained access controls, the challenges grow as your requirements and users scale.

Learn how to create a solution that evolves with your business needs while avoiding technical debt.Each shift forces your brain to refocus, sorting through your memory to figure out where you wereThe term context-switching is borrowed from operating systems (OS). OS can handle multiple processes in one processing unit (usually CPU) by putting one process on hold and processing another. Those systems can do context-switching, while our brains cannot.We switch tasks more often than we realize because our tools, such as apps and notifications, are designed to grab our attention. Our brains love novelty and rush toward any new message or update. We also feel pressure from work to respond immediately, which splits our focus even more (and our work cultures usually reward this). And there’s so much information—emails, chats, open tabs—that it’s easy to get distracted. lives in your working memoryhold only up to 7 items in short-term memorydevelopers need an average of 23 minutes to rebuild their focus after an interruption fullyWhen we are interrupted, we're not just losing minutes – we're degrading the quality of their work in several ways:developers who face frequent interruptions show signs of mental fatigue much earlier in the day, leading to more errors in their afternoon workA research study by Amoroso d'Aragona et al.

Their analysis revealed that:Frequent breaks and interruptionsProlonged gaps in activityInterrupted coding sessionslower code maintainabilityThese numbers aren't just statistics – they represent real problems that teams must fix later, creating a cycle of technical debt and cleanup work. A five-minute interruption during a critical problem-solving moment can create a long delay in task completion.We must discuss the flow state to understand why interruptions are so bad.

The server retains some data from previous requests, making future interactions dependent on past state.In software systems,  refers to any data that persists across requests, such as user sessions, shopping carts, or authentication details.The choice between stateless and stateful architecture can affect scalability, performance, complexity, and cost.In this article, we’ll break down both the approaches, their advantages and trade-offs, and when to use each—with real-world examples.In a , the system remembers client or process data () across multiple requests.Once a client connects, the server holds on to certain details—like user preferences, shopping cart contents, or authentication sessions—so the client doesn’t need to resend everything with each request.Stateful systems typically store the state data in a database or in-memory storage. During online shopping, when you add items to your cart, the website remembers your selections. If you navigate away to browse more items and then return to your cart, your items are still there, waiting for you to check out.Common Patterns in Stateful ArchitectureIf you use  session storage (i.e., each app server keeps its own sessions locally), you can configure your load balancer for “sticky sessions.” This means: Once a client is assigned to , all subsequent requests from that client are routed to .: If Server A fails, the user’s session data is lost or the user is forced to re-log in. Sticky sessions are also less flexible when scaling because you can’t seamlessly redistribute user traffic to other servers.2. Centralized Session StoreA more robust approach is to store session data in a  or  store (e.g., Redis). : All servers can access and update session data for any user. Any server can handle any request, because the session data is not tied to a specific server’s memory.: You introduce network overhead and rely on an external storage. If the centralized storage fails, you lose session data unless you have a fallback strategy.Personalized Experiences: Stateful systems can deliver highly tailored interactions, as they remember user preferences and past actions. Users can seamlessly resume activities where they left off, even if they disconnect and reconnect. Certain operations can be faster because the server already possesses necessary data. Maintaining state for a large number of users can become resource-intensive and complex, as each server needs to keep track of specific sessions. Managing and synchronizing state across multiple servers (if needed) introduces additional challenges. If a server holding a user's state fails, their session data might be lost.E-commerce Shopping Carts – Stores cart contents and user preferences across multiple interactions, even if the user navigates away and returns.Video Streaming Services (Netflix, YouTube) – Remembers user watch progress, recommendations, and session data for a seamless experience.Messaging Apps (WhatsApp, Slack) – Maintains active user sessions and message history for real-time communication.In a  architecture, the server does  preserve client-specific data between individual requests.Each request is treated as , with no memory of previous interactions.Every request must include all necessary information for processing.Once the server responds, it discards any temporary data used for that request.: Most  follow a stateless design. For instance, when you request weather data from a public API, you must provide all required details (e.g., location) in each request. The server processes it, sends a response, and forgets the interaction.Common Patterns in Stateless Architecture1. Token-Based Authentication (JWT)A very popular way to implement statelessness is through tokens, particularly  (JSON Web Tokens):Client Authenticates Once: The user logs in using credentials (username/password) for the first time, and the server issues a signed .: The client includes JWT token in each request (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <token> header).: The server validates the token’s signature and any embedded claims (e.g., user ID, expiry time).: The server does  need to store session data; it just verifies the token on each request.Many APIs, including OAuth-based authentication systems, use JWTs to enable stateless, scalable authentication.Stateless architectures benefit from , ensuring that repeated requests produce the same result. This prevents inconsistencies due to network retries or client errors. A  request with the same payload  updates the user’s data but doesn’t create duplicates.Idempotent APIsensures consistency and reliability, especially in distributed systems where requests might be retried automatically. Stateless systems are inherently easier to scale horizontally. New servers can be added effortlessly, as they don't need to maintain any specific user sessions. Since servers don't track state, the architecture is generally simpler and easier to manage. The failure of a single server won't disrupt user sessions, as data isn't tied to specific servers.With no session data stored on the server, you free up memory that would otherwise be reserved for session management.Easier to Cache Responses: Since requests are self-contained, caching layers (like CDNs) can more easily store and serve responses. Stateless systems can't provide the same level of personalization or context awareness as stateful systems without additional effort (like using cookies or tokens).The client must keep track of the authentication token or relevant data. If it loses the token, it must re-authenticate. Every request needs to carry all the required information, potentially leading to larger payloads.Microservices Architecture: Each service handles requests independently, relying on external databases or caches instead of maintaining session data.Public APIs (REST, GraphQL): Clients send tokens with each request, eliminating the need for server-side sessions.Tokens are securely stored on the device and sent with every request to authenticate users.Stateless endpoints make caching easier since responses depend only on request parameters, not stored session data. A CDNcan cache and serve repeated requests, improving performance and reducing backend load.There's no one-size-fits-all answer when choosing between stateful and stateless architectures.The best choice depends on your application’s needs, scalability goals, and user experience expectations.When to Choose Stateful ArchitectureStateful systems are ideal when user context and continuity are critical. Consider a stateful approach if your application:Requires personalization (e.g., user preferences, session history)Needs real-time interactions (e.g., chat applications, multiplayer gaming)Manages multi-step workflows (e.g., online banking transactions, checkout processes)Must retain authentication sessions for security and convenience A shopping cart in an e-commerce app should persist, so users don’t have to re-add items after refreshing the page.When to Choose Stateless ArchitectureStateless systems work best when scalability, simplicity, and resilience are top priorities. Use a stateless approach if your application:Handles a high volume of requests and needs to scale efficientlyDoesn’t require storing client-specific data between requestsNeeds fast, distributed processing without server dependenciesMust ensure reliability and failover readiness A weather API doesn’t need to remember previous requests. Each query includes the location, and the response is processed independently.Hybrid Approaches: The Best of Both WorldsMany modern applications  stateful and stateless components for flexibility.This hybrid approach allows:Stateless APIs for core functionality, ensuring high scalabilityStateful sessions for personalization, improving user experienceExternal session stores (e.g., Redis) to manage state while keeping app servers stateless A video streaming platform (e.g., Netflix) uses a stateless backend for streaming but retains stateful user sessions to track watch history and recommendations.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

Two owners of Nvidia’s new RTX 5090 Founders Edition GPUs have reported melted power connectors and damage to their PSUs. The images look identical to reports of RTX 4090 power cables burning or melting from two years ago. Nvidia blamed the issue on people not properly plugging the 12VHPWR power connection in fully and the PCI standards body blamed Nvidia.A Reddit poster upgraded from an RTX 4090 to an RTX 5090 and noticed “a burning smell playing ,” before turning off their PC and finding the damage. The images show burnt plastic at both the PSU end of the power connector and the part that connects directly to the GPU. The cable is one from MODDIY, a popular manufacturer of custom cables, and the poster claims it was “securely fastened and clicked on both sides (GPU and PSU).”While it’s tempting to blame the MODDIY cable, Spanish YouTuber Toro Tocho has experienced the same burnt cable (both at the GPU and PSU ends) with an RTX 5090 Founders Edition while using a cable supplied by PSU manufacturer FSP. Plastic has also melted into the PCIe 5.0 power connector on the power supply. MODDIY also responded in a Reddit thread, ruling out the “possibility of a defective cable or manufacturing error” and offering to cover the cost of repair if Nvidia and Asus don’t honor their warranties.YouTuber der8auer has also examined the Reddit poster’s equipment in person, and ruled out any form of user error in the process. He’s also found that this could be related to a current distribution problem with RTX 5090 Founders Edition models instead. Either way, nobody should be blaming 12VHPWR on end users.Nvidia originally introduced the 12VHPWR power connector on its RTX 40-series GPUs, and power supplies also debuted to support the new standard. The RTX 4090 Founders Edition was able to draw 450 watts over the 12VHPWR connector, while the new RTX 5090 draws up to 575 watts over a cable that’s rated up to 600 watts. After early issues with RTX 4090 connectors melting, PCI-SIG, the standards organization responsible for the 12VHPWR connector, has now updated it to a new 12V-2x6 connector on the GPU side and in some cases the PSU side, too.The 12V-2x6 connector has shorter sensing pins and longer conductor terminals, to improve reliability. “This might not sound like a huge difference, but it matters in ensuring that the power cable has been properly connected to whatever device is going to be pulling power from your system’s power supply,” explains Corsair.Nvidia uses the 12V-2x6 connector on its RTX 50-series GPUs, but you can still use existing 12VHPWR cables. “To be clear, this is not a new cable, it is an updated change to the pins in the socket, which is referred to as 12V-2x6,” says Corsair. PSU manufacturers like Corsair and MSI have adopted colored pins on their 12VHPWR cables so that if you can still see the yellow or grey pins it means the connector isn’t seated properly.While Intel and AMD are both members of the PCI-SIG group that helped develop the 12VHPWR power connector, only Nvidia has adopted the standard so far for consumer GPUs. Even AMD’s upcoming Radeon RX 9070-series are using existing 8-pin PCIe connections instead. AMD even suggested the 12VHPWR connector was a fire hazard in late 2022, when the company’s gaming marketing director Sasa Marinkovic tweeted “Stay safe this holiday season” alongside a picture of 8-pin connectors.12VHPWR has been branded a “dumpster fire,” thanks to design oversights that make it relatively easy for end users to not properly connect the cable securely. Cablemod was also forced to recall its 12VHPWR GPU power adapters last year after reports of melted adapters.We reached out to Nvidia to comment on these latest reports of RTX 5090 power connector issues, but the company refused to comment.: Article updated with comment from MODDIY and a new discovery from YouTuber der8auer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>jiff 0.2.0 released - A relatively new datetime library with automatic tzdb support, DST safe arithmetic/rounding and more</title><link>https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/releases/tag/0.2.0</link><author>/u/burntsushi</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 02:58:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Optimization problems in high-performance programs with Go</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1imo7jt/optimization_problems_in_highperformance_programs/</link><author>/u/JotaEspig</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 02:36:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello guys, I'm currently working on a chess engine using golang, where one of the most important things about it is the performance.

The feature is similar to the TamperMonkey and GreaseMonkey browser extensions, notes BleepingComputer. From the report: "Starting with desktop version 1.75, advanced Brave users will be able to write and inject their own scriptlets into a page, allowing for better control over their browsing experience," explained Brave in the announcement. Brave says that the feature was initially created to debug the browser's adblock feature but felt it was too valuable not to share with users. Brave's custom scriptlets feature can be used to modify webpages for a wide variety of privacy, security, and usability purposes.
 
For privacy-related changes, users write scripts that block JavaScript-based trackers, randomize fingerprinting APIs, and substitute Google Analytics scripts with a dummy version. In terms of customization and accessibility, the scriptlets could be used for hiding sidebars, pop-ups, floating ads, or annoying widgets, force dark mode even on sites that don't support it, expand content areas, force infinite scrolling, adjust text colors and font size, and auto-expand hidden content.

The ChatGPT creator plans to send its chip designs to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) for fabrication within the next few months, but the chip has not yet been formally announced.The OpenAI chip's full capabilities, technical details, and exact timeline are still unknown, but the company reportedly intends to iterate on the design and improve it over time, giving it leverage in negotiations with chip suppliers—and potentially granting the company future independence with a chip design it controls outright.In the past, we've seen other tech companies, such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta, create their own AI acceleration chips for reasons that range from cost reduction to relieving shortages of AI chips supplied by Nvidia, which enjoys a near-market monopoly on high-powered GPUs (such as the Blackwell series) for data center use.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Philip Goff &amp; Helen De Cruz on Finding (and Losing) Their Religion | Closer To Truth Chats</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrgbZVLpc1I</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qrgbZVLpc1I?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 20:24:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Two notable Closer To Truth contributors—and two good friends—discuss their intellectual, philosophical, and spiritual journeys in what seems to be opposite directions: one toward a form of Christianity and the other away from it.

And they’re still one of the most efficient ways to store data.” Yet open questions remain about how they work, he said. “This paper answers a couple of them in surprising ways.”Hash tables have become ubiquitous in computing, partly because of their simplicity and ease of use. They’re designed to allow users to do exactly three things: “query” (search for) an element, delete an element, or insert one into an empty slot. The first hash tables date back to the early 1950s, and computer scientists have studied and used them ever since. Among other things, researchers wanted to figure out the speed limits for some of these operations. How fast, for example, could a new search or insertion possibly be?The answer generally depends on the amount of time it takes to find an empty spot in a hash table. This, in turn, typically depends on how full the hash table is. Fullness can be described in terms of an overall percentage — this table is 50% full, that one’s 90% — but researchers often deal with much fuller tables. So instead, they may use a whole number, denoted by , to specify how close the hash table is to 100% full. If  is 100, then the table is 99% full. If  is 1,000, the table is 99.9% full. This measure of fullness offers a convenient way to evaluate how long it should take to perform actions like queries or insertions.Researchers have long known that for certain common hash tables, the expected time required to make the worst possible insertion — putting an item into, say, the last remaining open spot — is proportional to . “If your hash table is 99% full,” Kuszmaul said, “it makes sense that you would have to look at around 100 different positions to find a free slot.”In a 1985 paper, the computer scientist Andrew Yao, who would go on to win the A.M. Turing Award, asserted that among hash tables with a specific set of properties, the best way to find an individual element or an empty spot is to just go through potential spots randomly — an approach known as uniform probing. He also stated that, in the worst-case scenario, where you’re searching for the last remaining open spot, you can never do better than . for 40 years, most computer scientists assumed that Yao’s conjecture was true.Krapivin was not held back by the conventional wisdom for the simple reason that he was unaware of it. “I did this without knowing about Yao’s conjecture,”  he said. His explorations with tiny pointers led to a new kind of hash table — one that did not rely on uniform probing. And for this new hash table, the time required for worst-case queries and insertions is proportional to (log ) — far faster than . This result directly contradicted Yao’s conjecture. Farach-Colton and Kuszmaul helped Krapivin show that (log ) is the optimal, unbeatable bound for the popular class of hash tables Yao had written about.“This result is beautiful in that it addresses and solves such a classic problem,” said Guy Blelloch of Carnegie Mellon.“It’s not just that they disproved [Yao’s conjecture], they also found the best possible answer to his question,” said Sepehr Assadi of the University of Waterloo.  “We could have gone another 40 years before we knew the right answer.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>92-year-old describes her morning walk 🐿️ #JoyRidePBS #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFMv_UH6fcg</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cFMv_UH6fcg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 17:00:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Brigitta Bexelius, 92, starts her days at Wood Glen Hall in Santa Barbara with a walk, where she gets to enjoy nature.

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Young and radical - Why right-wing populism is on the rise | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSl4HIONvjc</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/CSl4HIONvjc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 17:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[There has recently been a trend in elections in Europe: young voters are turning to right-wing populist and right-wing extremist parties. Why is this happening?

In the Netherlands researchers say it was 18-34 year olds who helped the right-wing populist Geert Wilders to victory in the parliamentary elections. In Italy too, the Brothers of Italy, a party that is considered post-fascist, is in power. In Germany, there will be an early federal election at the end of February. According to surveys, the AfD, parts of which have been classified as right-wing extremist, has a good chance of significantly increasing its share of the vote. The renowned youth researcher Prof. Klaus Hurrelmann says that the success of such parties is also due to their aggressive advertising towards young voters in the digital sphere. In their report, Alexandra von Nahmen and Finlay Duncan examine the question of what else makes radical parties so attractive to young people that they end up voting for them.

The claim that human beings have or are an ‘immortal soul’ goes back to the ancient Greeks, if not further. In a pre-scientific world, it would seem absurd for our inner awareness not to continue, irrespective of what happens to our bodies. Today science rejects the soul, yet there are diverse viewpoints around.

For example, "John
Peters" and "John Peterson" are someone whose father was named
"Peter".  ("Peters" should be understood as "Peter's".)  Similarly we
have John Williams and John Williamson, John Roberts and John
Robertson, John Richards and John Richardson, John James and John
Jameson, John Johns and John Johnson, and so on.Often Dad's name was a nickname.  For example, a common nickname for
"John" is "Jack" and we have (less commonly) John Jacks and (more
commonly) John Jackson. John Bills and John Bilson, John Wills and
John Wilson, and John Willis and John Willison are Bill, Will, and
Wille, all short for William."Richard" is "Dick", and we have John Dicks (or Dix) and John Dickson
(or Dixon).  "Nicholas" is "Nick" and we have John Nicks (or Nix) and John
Nickson (or Nixon).Sometimes the name has the diminutive suffix “-kin” inserted.  Wilkins
is little Will's son, as is Wilkinson; Peterkins is little Peter's
son.These patterns are so common that if you find surnames that follow
them you can almost always infer a forename, although it may be one
that is no longer common, or that is spelled differently.  For
example, many people are named Pierce, Pearse, Pierson, or Pearson,
which is from the name Pierre, Piers or Pierce, still used in English
although much less common than in the past.  (It is from the same root
as Peter.)  Perkins is little Pierre.  
Robin used to be a nickname for
Robert (it's “Robkin” with the difficult “-bk-” simplified to just
“-b-”) and we have John Robins and John Robinson. Sometimes, the pattern is there but the name is unclear because it is
a nickname that is now so uncommon that it is neatly forgotten.  The
fathers of John Watts, Watson, and Watkins were called Wat, which used
to be short for Walter.  John Hobbs, John Hobson, and Hobkins are
named for Hob, which was short for Robert in the same way that Rob and
Bob are still.  (I had a neighbor who was called Hob, and told me his
family claimed that it was short for Robert, but that he wasn't sure.
I assured him that they were correct.)  “Daw”, an archaic nickname for
“David”, gives us Dawes, Dawkins, and Dawson.Back in September when I started this article I thought on John Gibbs
and John Gibson.  Who's named "Gib", and why?  Is it archaic nickname?
Yes!  It was short for Gilbert.  Then I forgot about the draft article
until today when I woke up wondering about John Simpson (and, I
realize now, John Simms and John Simkins). And it transpired "Sim" or
"Simme" was once a common nickname for Simon.I would welcome further examples.Vicki Rosenzweig reminds me that another lost nickname for Richard is
"Hick" (like "Rick" and "Dick") and from this we get Hicks, Hix,
Hickson, Hixon, Hickman, and (she informs me) "Hickmott"."-mott" perhaps indicates a male in-law, according to the Dictionary
of American Family Names via
Ancestrry.com.
The only other clear example of this that I noticed was "Willmott".
Note that Gaelic names like Dermott are not of this type; the
resemblance is coincidental.We get Hodge / Hodges / Hodgson / Hodgkins from "Hodge", an arcahic
nickname for Roger.Lucy Keer suggests that Bateson / Bates is from "Bat", an archair
nickname for Bartholomew.Christopher Taylor reminds me that in Atkins and Atkinson the "At-" is
short for "Adam", and   similarly in "Addis" and "Addison".  I know a
guy named Atteson but I'm not sure it is the same thing.Response to this article has been too much for me to keep up with."Dob" is another old nickname for "Robert", giving us "Dobson";"Dodge" another nickname for Roger, hence Dodgson, as in Louis Carrol's real name, Charles Dodgson;"Tibb" is an old nickname for Theobald, giving surnames like "Tibbs" and "Tibbets";"Hud" for "Hugh", giving us the Hudsons.I also asked Claude for suggestions:I'm going to paste a blog article that discusses common English
  surnames that are patronymic versions of forenames that no longer
  exist.  For example, the common surname "Watson" is from "Wat", and
  "Wat" was once a common nickname for "Walter", but no longer used.
  I would like you to list ten similar examples that are not mentioned
  in the article.Here are ten examples of common English surnames derived from obsolete
  forenames or nicknames, different from those mentioned in the article:Higgins/Higgs - from "Hick," a medieval pet form of RichardTimms/Timson - from "Tim," originally a medieval nickname for TimothyHodgson/Hodges - from "Hodge," once a common nickname for RogerAtkins/Atkinson - from "At" or "Atte," medieval diminutive of AdamParkins/Parkinson - from "Perkin," diminutive of Peter/PierreJudson/Judd - from "Judd," medieval nickname for JordanMalkins/Malkinson - from "Malk," diminutive of MalcolmLarkins/Larkin - from "Larry" or "Laurence," medieval form of LawrenceCollins/Colson - from "Col," medieval nickname for NicholasHuggins/Huggett - from "Hug," medieval pet form of HughRemember that some of these might be made up.  For example,
Wiktionary claims that #7 is ,
from , a nickname for Mary.  Who's right?  I don't know.  The
only way to settle this is with a cage match!  I hope.I complained that #2 was not to spec because “Tim” is still common,
and demanded a replacement:Rankins/Rankin - from "Ran," a medieval diminutive of RandolphI also asked Claude if I had made any errors, and it said:The article claims that "Robin" comes from "Robkin" with "bk"
  simplified to "b". This is incorrect."Robin" is actually a French
  diminutive of Robert, coming from Old French Robin/Rovin. …]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: HTML visualization of a PDF file&apos;s internal structure</title><link>https://github.com/desgeeko/pdfsyntax/blob/main/docs/browse.md</link><author>desgeeko</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:52:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi,

Initially, Brahms said, they would propose something witty and profound. Later, they admitted that they’d likely express appreciation and love, or something spiritual — if they could even manage to speak, when lucidity and intelligibility become hurdles. Brahms witnessed this firsthand at the bedside of his dying mother. Even though she’d spent years helping him edit his book, they’d never discussed what they thought their last words would be.It didn’t matter, because the reality was quite different.“In her case, due to debilitating illness, it was not a clear punctuated statement,” Brahms told me in an email, with evident surprise. “It was more of a slow and fading dialogue.”This dissonance between the idealized notion of dying speech, based on people’s expectations and cultural ideals, and the reality of final moments so often complicates our understanding of death. And when delirium enters the equation, the gap between expectation and reality widens even further.What should we make of people who can speak and yet make no sense?On one hand, there’s a very good chance that a dying person will be delirious at the end of life. In fact, in palliative care and hospice spaces, 58 to 88 percent of cancer patients are delirious in the last week to hours before death. In William Osler’s landmark study of dying, 28 patients out of the total 486 were described as delirious, with his observers using words like “irrational,” “mind wandering,” “demented,” and in one case “raging.”“I don’t want to call it a nearly universal feature of the end-of-life experience,” David Wright, a Canadian medical ethnographer, told me, “but as you die, unless you die very suddenly in an instant, your various bodily systems start to work differently until they stop working at all. And that includes the way that you think, and that includes the way that you communicate.”In palliative care and hospice spaces, well over half of cancer patients are delirious in the last week to hours before death.Ancient medical writers distinguished between two types of delirium: , the restless variety, and , an inert, dull state. Modern researchers keep this distinction, describing delirium as either quiet, listless, apathetic, and “pseudo wakeful,” or as a restlessness in which patients are “muttering” and “talkative.” Delirium was one of the first medical conditions ever described by Greek and Roman writers almost 2,000 years ago. The Greek philosopher Celsus introduced the word  in the second century CE; the word came from the Latin , which means to go out of the furrow ( is Latin for “furrow”). The delirious plow leaves the furrow of sense. A modern person might think that leaving the planned track is a desirable thing, until they familiarize themselves with a single-bladed plow and realize the inconvenience of an errant ox-pulled plow skittering across the field’s surface.Despite this pedigree, the exact biological mechanisms behind delirium aren’t well understood, but it appears to stem from neuronal dysfunction, probably due to neurotransmitter fluctuations. Neurons in the brain aren’t dying (which is why sometimes people can recover from delirium) but disconnecting from each other. Basically, delirium is the result of a neurochemical commotion. Now clinicians look for three types of delirium: a restless, hyperactive form, a listless form, and a mix of the two.Delirium is very common among the dying, particularly in the later stages, where that lethargic type shows up often. As a diagnosis, it covers a complex of symptoms and isn’t a single thing. Despite its prevalence, doctors don’t reliably recognize delirium. It’s often mistaken for dementia, depression, or psychosis. In a study of 100 consecutive cases of delirium in a palliative care unit, researchers found that 33 percent of patients were classified with the hypoactive, lethargic form. They had the same impairment in cognitive functioning as patients with other variants, showing similar deficits in orientation, memory, and comprehension on cognitive test scores. This variegated presentation makes it hard to tell when someone is delirious. Though clinicians want to take it seriously, they don’t have a uniform method for recognizing delirium or dealing with it therapeutically.On the other hand, delirium seems to outstrip people’s ability — and their willingness — to grasp a phenomenon as simultaneously biological, emotional, and social. It has what David Wright called a relational dimension, in the sense that any individual’s delirium impacts other people’s perceptions of the relationship. Some find it traumatizing and distressing, others less so. In either case, what seems to help is when delirium is described as a normal part of dying, in the same way that baby babbling is described as a normal feature of language acquisition. Some medical staff try to normalize the delirium as part of the natural process of dying, and they encourage family members to enter the hallucinatory world — or at least not to fight it. Many hospices recommend the latter as well: “Do not contradict, explain away, belittle or argue about what the person claims to have seen or heard,” reads a short text that a hospice provides about the dying process. “Just because you cannot see or hear it does not mean it is not real to your loved one. Affirm his or her experience. They are normal and common.”By itself, the brain explanation isn’t soothing. What does help is taking advantage of the interaction window that remains. Or you open another window, as if that’s the one that the other person wants to operate with. You might respond, “So you say you’re going on a trip. Who do you think will be waiting for you?” Or, “Tell me some nice things you remember about your mother.” Family members might be told that the patient has already undergone a sort of social death; though their body is present, the previous person they is gone, so a new relationship is required. So while your father’s brain is the author of some insult, and his body its animator, your father as you knew him isn’t the principal of that offensive utterance.Some families take it better than others — some want to deny what’s happening, while others roll with it (“Oh, you’re seeing bugs? What’s it look like?”). For other family members, some meaning needs to be made from the delirium. “It can be very meaningful for family members to say, ‘Oh, Dad’s now with Mom,’ who is dead. That can be a great source of comfort,” a doctor who often treats delirium told me.I faced this with my own grandmother. I’d known my father’s mother, Norma, from childhood. A bright-faced, cheery woman, she’d fold me in her arms, say that she loved me, then laugh chirpingly and say that she prayed for me, that unmistakable Irish grandmother code for “I want you to go to Mass.” Now I was no longer a child, and now she was dying. The gray skies on our visit to the hospital will be forever seared in my memory. When my wife and I entered my grandmother’s room, I told her who I was. Her eyelids fluttered open, and her eyes focused on me, her gaunt face lit up, she reached out her arms, I hugged and kissed her. “Michael-Jean, you’re an angel!” she exclaimed. “You’re an angel!”At first I was concerned — does she know it’s me, not an angel? Apparently so, she said my name, then repeated joyfully, “You’re an angel, you’re an angel.” Delirium? Maybe. But when your beloved grandmother calls you an angel, you reach for the interpretation that feels most loving. That has to be her talking, she’s still there. She said what she said; the words, they’re right there, her last ones, as far as I’m concerned. She became unresponsive shortly after and died two days later.My father remembers this differently. He maintains that she roused to a saying of the Lord’s Prayer. But I won’t argue — from both of our stories, we end up with some morsels of closure, and that’s what feeds us.From a linguistic perspective, delirious language is unhinged and incoherent. People who are delirious after surgery and then recover can sometimes relate their feelings of being briefly outside the furrow of sense, which reduced them to a state of abject terror.Osler might have been surprised. “I remember that everything changed to me,” reported one patient. “Suddenly I was a prisoner in a Nazi camp, and I thought that the nurses were the Nazi camp guards . . . and I wondered whatever happened since the nurses had become so unkind to me although they were so nice before.” They reported seeing things that were beautiful, awe-inspiring, and pleasurable. They saw fragments of past events mixed up with the present. And they heard people talking to them but didn’t know what they wanted, nor could they communicate with them.As with all these phenomena, delirium involves experiences at the edge of the interaction window, or far beyond it. In many instances, that window has been shut, perhaps not forever. In the case above, family members who knew the person in a “normal” state were also shocked at losing emotional and cognitive access to their loved one. They missed knowing about the other person’s interior life and struggled to figure out if the person with delirium was comfortable or distressed. To deal with this, the advice seems to be: Don’t engage in the main interaction window, because your loved one’s not there; instead, open another interaction window on their terms. That will allow you to be present without expectations or demands.Of course, another option is to deny the existence of delirium altogether, as Maggie Callanan and Patricia Kelley’s 1992 book “Final Gifts” does. Their book proposed that dying people begin using a symbolic language particular to the end of life that must be carefully listened to, written down, and interpreted. “Health-care professionals and families may assume that what they’re hearing and seeing is confusion . . . unfortunately, dying people are often labeled ‘confused’ without adequate assessment,” Callanan and Kelley wrote. To those authors, the only reality is the special symbolic language of the dying, and the brain-based understandings of delirium diminish those messages or their meanings. (They don’t have a monopoly on this, by the way. Nearly 40 percent of Indian family members said that delirium was the cause of supernatural beliefs, emotional stress, or a failure of religious observance — and did not have biomedical origins.)Given the documented prevalence of delirium, it was a bold position to take. However, in a 1998 interview, Callanan walked the rejection back. “I’m not here to say that everything a confused patient says has great significance. It’s often very hard, even paying close attention, to find exactly what the person is saying. Seventy percent of people dying of illness, at some point, have some confusion; that’s a lot of confusion. However, our point is to always listen specifically to the words.”Several years later, on a speaking tour to Chicago, Callanan reversed again, telling the  that delirious behaviors aren’t the product of mental confusion or drug mis-dosing. “The confusion is ours,” she said. “The patient knows what’s going on.”The newspaper reporter also quoted, in contrast, the views of Joel Frader, a palliative care physician, who identified the source of hallucinations and other unusual behaviors as the failing brain. “There are some fairly characteristic changes in brain chemistry that people have documented as death occurs, whether it’s lack of oxygen or high levels of carbon dioxide or changes in nutrition getting to the brain,” he told the newspaper.If no one gets a clear model about the language they should produce at the end of their lives, except that it be pithy, poignant, and meaningful, then it risks ending up delirious and nonsensical.His take was not only frank and sharp, but it reiterated what Victorian doctors also warned: The existence of God or the afterlife won’t be proven with people’s dying words or their hallucinations, because they are “matters of faith.” The organic response of the brain to the body’s failure, on the other hand, is a matter of physiology. Implicit is the idea it works that way for everybody.“I do understand people trying to get some meaning out of everything they witness, but delirium is real, and it happens a lot,” Romayne Gallagher, a palliative care physician in British Columbia told me. She didn’t recommend “Final Gifts” to people because of its unrealistic view of delirium. “Certainly the misperception of reality plays a role in delirium — people seeing ants on the ceiling (spotted ceiling tiles) and seeing a bowl of rice (a glowing white lamp globe) — but if delirium goes beyond that, it seems to empty the limbic system’s treasure trove of horrors, which doesn’t seem to relate to the person’s experience. By that I mean people seeing a train coming at them or seeing a loved one on fire just outside the window.”My speculation is that the interpretive control promoted in “Final Gifts” reflects a cultural adaptation to dilemmas posed by delirium to a  approach to language at the end of life. That is, if no one gets a clear model about the language they should produce at the end, except for the vague sense that it should be pithy, poignant, and uniquely reflective of who they were, then it risks ending up delirious and nonsensical (if it exists at all). And if loved ones are directed to attend to all of the utterances, how should the non-sensical ones be interpreted? As if they contain some meaning.Meanwhile, other religious practices keep dying people occupied, authoring for them what to utter, chant, or pray. Sharing linguistic agency in this way looks like a wise cultural adaptation to the prevalence of delirium. In those traditions, only the prescribed words matter — everything else becomes noise, harmless and inconsequential.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>@osherove about Pipeline Driven Organizations</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOKEXaxRdfs</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xOKEXaxRdfs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:01:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out the full version on our YouTube channel now! #GOTOcon #GOTOams #PipelineDriven #Cooperative #CooperativePipeline #CoOpsPipelines #ContinuousDelivery #CICD #DevOps #DevSecOps #DevTestOps #Programming #DevOps2 #SDLC #RoyOsherove #Viral #ViralShorts #GOTO

Mostly by throwing absurd amounts of money at the problem. Many of those billions go towards building cheap or free services that operate at a significant loss. The tech giants that run them all are hoping to attract as many users as possible, so that they can capture the market, and become the dominant or only party that can offer them. It is the classic Silicon Valley playbook. Once dominance is reached, expect the enshittification to begin.A likely way to earn back all that money for developing these LLMs will be by tweaking their outputs to the liking of whoever pays the most. An example of what that such tweaking looks like is the refusal of DeepSeek's R1 to discuss what happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989. That one is obviously politically motivated, but ad-funded services won't exactly be fun either. In the future, I fully expect to be able to have a frank and honest discussion about the Tiananmen events with an American AI agent, but the only one I can afford will have assumed the persona of Father Christmas who, while holding a can of Coca-Cola, will intersperse the recounting of the tragic events with a joyful "Ho ho ho... Didn't you know? The holidays are coming!"But there is hope. One of the tricks of an upcoming player to shake up the market, is to undercut the incumbents by releasing their model for free, under a permissive license. This is what DeepSeek just did with their DeepSeek-R1. Google did it earlier with the Gemma models, as did Meta with Llama. We can download these models ourselves and run them on our own hardware. Better yet, people can take these models and scrub the biases from them. And we can download those scrubbed models and run those on our own hardware. And then we can finally have some truly useful LLMs.That hardware can be a hurdle, though. There are two options to choose from if you want to run an LLM locally. You can get a big, powerful video card from Nvidia, or you can buy an Apple. Either is expensive. The main spec that indicates how well an LLM will perform is the amount of memory available. VRAM in the case of GPUs, normal RAM in the case of Apples. Bigger is better here. More RAM means bigger models, which will dramatically improve the quality of the output. Personally, I'd say one needs at least over 24GB to be able to run anything useful. That will fit a 32 billion parameter model with a little headroom to spare. Building, or buying, a workstation that is equipped to handle that can easily cost thousands of euros.So what to do, if you don't have that amount of money to spare? You buy second-hand! This is a viable option, but as always, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Memory may be the primary concern, but don't underestimate the importance of memory bandwidth and other specs. Older equipment will have lower performance on those aspects. But let's not worry too much about that now. I am interested in building something that at least can run the LLMs in a usable way. Sure, the latest Nvidia card might do it faster, but the point is to be able to do it at all. Powerful online models can be nice, but one should at the very least have the option to switch to a local one, if the situation calls for it.Below is my attempt to build such a capable AI computer without spending too much. I ended up with a workstation with 48GB of VRAM that cost me around 1700 euros. I could have done it for less. For instance, it was not strictly necessary to buy a brand new dummy GPU (see below), or I could have found someone that would 3D print the cooling fan shroud for me, instead of shipping a ready-made one from a faraway country. I'll admit, I got a bit impatient at the end when I found out I had to buy yet another part to make this work. For me, this was an acceptable tradeoff.This is the full cost breakdown:Nvidia Tesla Cooling Fan KitMODDIY Main Power Adaptor CableAnd this is what it looked liked when it first booted up with all the parts installed:I'll give some context on the parts below, and after that, I'll run a few quick tests to get some numbers on the performance.The Z440 was an easy pick because I already owned it. This was the starting point. About two years ago, I wanted a computer that could serve as a host for my virtual machines. The Z440 has a Xeon processor with 12 cores, and this one sports 128GB of RAM. Many threads and a lot of memory, that should work for hosting VMs. I bought it secondhand and then swapped the 512GB hard drive for a 6TB one to store those virtual machines. 6TB is not required for running LLMs, and therefore I did not include it in the breakdown. But if you plan to collect many models, 512GB might not be enough.I have come to like this workstation. It feels all very solid, and I haven't had any problems with it. At least, until I started this project. It turns out that HP does not like competition, and I encountered some difficulties when swapping components.This is the magic ingredient. GPUs are expensive. But, as with the HP Z440, often one can find older equipment, that used to be top of the line and is still very capable, second-hand, for relatively little money. These Teslas were meant to run in server farms, for things like 3D rendering and other graphic processing. They come equipped with 24GB of VRAM. Nice. They fit in a PCI-Express 3.0 x16 slot. The Z440 has two of those, so we buy two. Now we have 48GB of VRAM. Double nice.The catch is the part about that they were meant for servers. They will work fine in the PCIe slots of a normal workstation, but in servers the cooling is managed differently. Beefy GPUs consume a lot of power and can run very hot. That is the reason consumer GPUs always come equipped with big fans. The cards need to take care of their own cooling. The Teslas, however, have no fans whatsoever. They get just as hot, but expect the server to supply a steady flow of air to cool them. The enclosure of the card is somewhat shaped like a pipe, and you have two options: blow in air from one side or blow it in from the other side. How is that for flexibility? You absolutely must blow some air into it, though, or you will damage it as soon as you put it to work.The solution is simple: just mount a fan on one end of the pipe. And indeed, it seems a whole cottage industry has grown of people that sell 3D-printed shrouds that hold a standard 60mm fan in just the right place. The problem is, the cards themselves are already quite bulky, and it is not easy to find a configuration that fits two cards and two fan mounts in the computer case. The seller who sold me my two Teslas was kind enough to include two fans with shrouds, but there was no way I could fit all of those into the case. So what do we do? We buy more parts.This is where things got annoying. The HP Z440 had a 700 Watt PSU, which might have been enough. But I wasn't sure, and I needed to buy a new PSU anyway because it did not have the right connectors to power the Teslas. Using this handy website, I deduced that 850 Watt would be sufficient, and I bought the NZXT C850. It is a modular PSU, meaning that you only need to plug in the cables that you actually need. It came with a neat bag to store the spare cables. One day, I might give it a good cleaning and use it as a toiletry bag.Unfortunately, HP does not like things that are not HP, so they made it difficult to swap the PSU. It does not fit physically, and they also changed the main board and CPU connectors. All PSUs I have ever seen in my life are rectangular boxes. The HP PSU also is a rectangular box, but with a cutout, making sure that none of the normal PSUs will fit. For no technical reason at all. This is just to mess with you.The mounting was eventually solved by using two random holes in the grill that I somehow managed to align with the screw holes on the NZXT. It sort of hangs stable now, and I feel lucky that this worked. I have seen Youtube videos where people resorted to double-sided tape.The connector required... another purchase.There is another issue with using server GPUs in this consumer workstation. The Teslas are intended to crunch numbers, not to play video games with. Consequently, they don't have any ports to connect a monitor to. The BIOS of the HP Z440 does not like this. It refuses to boot if there is no way to output a video signal. This computer will run headless, but we have no other choice. We have to get a third video card, that we don't to intent to use ever, just to keep the BIOS happy.This can be the most scrappy card that you can find, of course, but there is a requirement: we must make it fit on the main board. The Teslas are bulky and fill the two PCIe 3.0 x16 slots. The only slots left that can physically hold a card are one PCIe x4 slot and one PCIe x8 slot. See this website for some background on what those names mean. One cannot buy any x8 card, though, because often even when a GPU is advertised as x8, the actual connector on it might be just as wide as an x16. Electronically it is an x8, physically it is an x16. That won't work on this main board, we really need the small connector.Nvidia Tesla Cooling Fan KitAs said, the challenge is to find a fan shroud that fits in the case. After some searching, I found this kit on Ebay an bought two of them. They came delivered complete with a 40mm fan, and it all fits perfectly.Be warned that they make an awful lot of noise. You don't want to keep a computer with these fans under your desk.To keep an eye on the temperature, I whipped up this quick script and put it in a cron job. It periodically reads out the temperature on the GPUs and sends that to my Homeassistant server:In Homeassistant I added a graph to the dashboard that displays the values over time:As one can see, the fans were noisy, but not particularly effective. 90 degrees is far too hot. I searched the internet for a reasonable upper limit but could not find anything specific. The documentation on the Nvidia site mentions a temperature of 47 degrees Celsius. But, what they mean by that is the temperature of the ambient air surrounding the GPU, not the measured value on the chip. You know, the number that actually is reported. Thanks, Nvidia. That was helpful.After some further searching and reading the opinions of my fellow internet citizens, my guess is that things will be fine, provided that we keep it in the lower 70s. But don't quote me on that.My first attempt to remedy the situation was by setting a maximum to the power consumption of the GPUs. According to this Reddit thread, one can lower the power consumption of the cards by 45% at the cost of only 15% of the performance. I tried it and... did not notice any difference at all. I wasn't sure about the drop in performance, having only a couple of minutes of experience with this configuration at that point, but the temperature characteristics were definitely unchanged.And then a light bulb flashed on in my head. You see, just before the GPU fans, there is a fan in the HP Z440 case. In the photo above, it is in the right corner, inside the black box. This is a fan that sucks air into the case, and I figured this would work in tandem with the GPU fans that blow air into the Teslas. But this case fan was not spinning at all, because the rest of the computer did not need any cooling. Looking into the BIOS, I found a setting for the  of the case fans. It ranged from 0 to 6 stars and was currently set to 0. Putting it at a higher setting did wonders for the temperature. It also made more noise.I'll reluctantly admit that the third video card was helpful when adjusting the BIOS setting.MODDIY Main Power Adaptor Cable and Akasa Multifan AdaptorFortunately, sometimes things just work. These two items were plug and play. The MODDIY adaptor cable connected the PSU to the main board and CPU power sockets.I used the Akasa to power the GPU fans from a 4-pin Molex. It has the nice feature that it can power two fans with 12V and two with 5V. The latter obviously reduces the speed and thus the cooling power of the fan. But it also reduces noise. Fiddling a bit with this and the case fan setting, I found an acceptable tradeoff between noise and temperature. For now at least. Maybe I will need to revisit this in the summer.Inference speed. I collected these numbers by running  with the  flag and asking it five times to write a story and averaging the result:Performancewise,  is configured with:All models have the default quantization that  will pull for you if you don't specify anything.Another important finding: Terry is by far the most popular name for a tortoise, followed by Turbo and Toby. Harry is a favorite for hares. All LLMs are loving alliteration.Over the days I kept an eye on the power consumption of the workstation:Note that these numbers were taken with the 140W power cap active.As one can see, there is another tradeoff to be made. Keeping the model on the card improves latency, but consumes more power. My current setup is to have two models loaded, one for coding, the other for generic text processing, and keep them on the GPU for up to an hour after last use.After all that, am I happy that I started this project? Yes, I think I am.I spent a bit more money than planned, but I got what I wanted: a way of locally running medium-sized models, completely under my own control.It was a good choice to start with the workstation I already owned, and see how far I could come with that. If I had started with a new machine from scratch, it definitely would have cost me more. It would have taken me much longer too, as there would have been many more options to choose from. I would also have been very tempted to follow the hype and buy the latest and greatest of everything. New and shiny toys are fun. But if I buy something new, I want it to last for years. Confidently predicting where AI will go in 5 years time is impossible right now, so having a cheaper machine, that will last at least some while, feels satisfactory to me.I wish you good luck on your own AI journey. I'll report back if I find something new or interesting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Proposal To Raise The Linux Kernel&apos;s Default Timer Frequency To 1000Hz</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-2025-Proposal-1000Hz</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 11:43:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A patch sent out on Sunday by Google engineer Qais Yousef is proposing to raise the Linux kernel's default timer frequency from 250Hz to 1000Hz...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RADV Vulkan Video Adds Low Latency Encoding Support</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/RADV-Vulkan-Video-Low-Latency</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 11:31:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Adding to the Vulkan Video support for Mesa's Radeon "RADV" Vulkan driver is honoring of the low latency encoding options...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft Continues Enhancing Its Azure Linux 3.0 Distribution With February Update</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Azure-Linux-3.0.20250206</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 11:07:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft engineers released Azure Linux 3.0.20250206 overnight as the newest monthly update to this in-house Microsoft Linux distribution that is used within their Azure cloud infrastructure and a variety of other purposes at the Redmond company...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Infinite horizontal arrays of text editors</title><link>https://zeminary.com/arrays/app.html</link><author>tsydenzhap</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:25:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Iwo Jima: WWII in the Pacific</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/iwo-jima-wwii-in-the-pacific</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67a5ffad9c6f7f7f28ca817f/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=XmWKIvY0PzYQ9laffKEQzYQFNIzxWzY8Lxz6KuHWGpU" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[80 years ago, on the rocky volcanic island of Iwo Jima, the vicious battle for the Pacific reached ever bloodier crescendos.

After a decade of partnership with Harvard, Yale's CS50 course will no longer be offered starting in fall 2025.... One of Yale's largest computer science courses, jointly taught with Harvard University, was canceled during a monthly faculty meeting after facing budgetary challenges. [Yale's endowment is $40+ billion]... Since Yale started offering the course in 2015, CS50 has consistently seen enrollment numbers in the hundreds and was often the department's largest class.... According to [Yale instructor Ozan] Erat, the original [anonymous] donation that made CS50 possible ended in June 2024, and the cost of employing so many undergraduate learning assistants for the course had become unsustainable.

No likes, no shares, no engagement.There’s two lies we tell ourselves:If I write it, they will come. They won’t. There are billions of blog posts out there. The internet is an infinite void, and your blog is a whisper in a hurricane.If nobody reads it, it’s a waste of time.There is a hidden value in blogging.
There’s an old Zen saying: “Chop wood, carry water.” You do it not for the applause but because it needs doing.Blogging forces clarity. It makes you structure your thoughts, sharpen your perspective. You stop writing fluff because — let’s be honest — you’re writing for yourself. And if you can’t keep yourself interested, nobody else stands a chance.When you write, you think better. When you think better, you create better.So, who’s there real audience?You’re not just writing for today’s invisible audience. You’re writing for:Future you.

Only eight people remain in the core team around Rust for Linux... Miguel Ojeda therefore launched a survey among kernel developers, including those outside the Rust community, and presented some of the more important voices in his FOSDEM talk. The overall mood towards Rust remains favorable, especially as Linus Torvalds and Greg Kroah-Hartman are convinced of the necessity of Rust integration. This is less about rapid progress and more about finding new talent for kernel development in the future. 
The reaction was mostly positive, judging by Ojeda's slides: 

- "2025 will be the year of Rust GPU drivers..." — Daniel Almedia 

- "I think the introduction of Rust in the kernel is one of the most exciting development experiments we've seen in a long time." — Andrea Righi

 - "[T]he project faces unique challenges. Rust's biggest weakness, as a language, is that relatively few people speak it. Indeed, Rust is not a language for beginners, and systems-level development complicates things even more. That said, the Linux kernel project has historically attracted developers who love challenging software — if there's an open source group willing to put the extra effort for a better OS, it's the kernel devs." — Carlos Bilbao 

- "I played a little with [Rust] in user space, and I just absolutely hate the cargo concept... I hate having to pull down other code that I do not trust. At least with shared libraries, I can trust a third party to have done the build and all that... [While Rust should continue to grow in the kernel], if a subset of C becomes as safe as Rust, it may make Rust obsolete..." Steven Rostedt 

Rostedt wasn't sure if Rust would attract more kernel contributors, but did venture this opinion. "I feel Rust is more of a language that younger developers want to learn, and C is their dad's language." 

But still "contention exists within the kernel development community between those pro-Rust and -C camps," argues The New Stack, citing the latest remarks from kernel maintainer Christoph Hellwig (who had earlier likened the mixing of Rust and C to cancer). Three days later Hellwig reiterated his position again on the Linux kernel mailing list:

"Every additional bit that another language creeps in drastically reduces the maintainability of the kernel as an integrated project. The only reason Linux managed to survive so long is by not having internal boundaries, and adding another language completely breaks this. You might not like my answer, but I will do everything I can do to stop this. This is NOT because I hate Rust. While not my favourite language it's definitively one of the best new ones and I encourage people to use it for new projects where it fits. I do not want it anywhere near a huge C code base that I need to maintain." 

But the article also notes that Google "has been a staunch supporter of adding Rust to the kernel for Linux running in its Android phones."
The use of Rust in the kernel is seen as a way to avoid memory vulnerabilities associated with C and C++ code and to add more stability to the Android OS. "Google's wanting to replace C code with Rust represents a small piece of the kernel but it would have a huge impact since we are talking about billions of phones," Ojeda told me after his talk. 

In addition to Google, Rust adoption and enthusiasm for it is increasing as Rust gets more architectural support and as "maintainers become more comfortable with it," Ojeda told me. "Maintainers have already told me that if they could, then they would start writing Rust now," Ojeda said. "If they could drop C, they would do it...." 

Amid the controversy, there has been a steady stream of vocal support for Ojeda. Much of his discussion also covered statements given by advocates for Rust in the kernel, ranging from lead developers of the kernel and including Linux creator Linus Torvalds himself to technology leads from Red Hat, Samsung, Google, Microsoft and others.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Non-committal love - Are situationships good for us? | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgnmmpKleq8</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bgnmmpKleq8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 17:00:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The desire for non-committal love is a dating trend among singles aged 18 to 25.

Some Christian theologians claim that aspects of Christology can articulate with fundamental understandings of science. Most scientists would be baffled by the claim.

Can biology be explained entirely in terms of chemistry and then physics? If so, that’s “reductionism.” Or are there “emergent” properties at higher levels of the hierarchy of life that cannot be explained by properties at lower or more basic levels?

But he complains that many developers "use C++ as if it was still the previous millennium," in an article titled 21st Century C++ that promises "the key concepts on which performant, type safe, and flexible C++ software can be built: resource management, life-time management, error-handling, modularity, and generic programming... 

"At the end, I present ways to ensure that code is contemporary, rather than relying on outdated, unsafe, and hard-to-maintain techniques: guidelines and profiles."

To help developers focus on effective use of contemporary C++ and avoid outdated "dark corners" of the language, sets of guidelines have been developed. Here I focus on the C++ Core guidelines that I consider the most ambitious... My principal aim is a type-safe and resource-safe use of ISO standard C++. That is: 

- Every object is exclusively used according to its definition
- No resource is leaked 
This encompasses what people refer to as memory safety and much more. It is not a new goal for C++. Obviously, it cannot be achieved for every use of C++, but by now we have years of experience showing that it can be done for modern code, though so far enforcement has been incomplete... When thinking about C++, it is important to remember that C++ is not just a language but part of an ecosystem consisting of implementations, libraries, tools, teaching, and more. 
WG21 (and others) are working on "profiles" to enforce guidelines (though they're "not yet available, except for experimental and partial versions"). But Stroustrup writes that the C++ Core Guidelines "use a strategy known as subset-of-superset."

 First: extend the language with a few library abstractions: use parts of the standard library and add a tiny library to make use of the guidelines convenient and efficient (the Guidelines Support Library, GSL).
 Next: subset: ban the use of low-level, inefficient, and error-prone features. 
What we get is "C++ on steroids": Something simple, safe, flexible, and fast; rather than an impoverished subset or something relying on massive run-time checking. Nor do we create a language with novel and/or incompatible features. The result is 100% ISO standard C++. Messy, dangerous, low-level features can still be enabled and used when needed. 
Stroustrup writes that the C++ Core Guidelines focus on rules "we hope that everyone eventually could benefit from."

No uninitialized variables
No range or nullptr violations
No resource leaks
No dangling pointers
No type violations
No invalidation

Last weekend Donald Trump announced 25 per cent tariffs on most imports from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10 per cent levy on imports from China. Canadian oil was hit at a lower rate of 10 per cent. The duties will take effect from Tuesday. Just days later these tariffs were suspended.

Trump said the actions were in response to the “major threat” posed by the flow of migrants and drugs into the US across its borders with Canada and Mexico.

Is our perception of reality just an illusion? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Gary O’Reilly explore the neuroscience behind magic with magician Teller (of Penn & Teller) and neuroscientist Susana Martinez-Conde.

We dive into the world of sensory perception, illusions, and the tricks magicians use to exploit the brain’s blind spots. How do our brains construct reality rather than simply perceiving it? Susana breaks down the science behind misdirection and cognitive illusions, revealing how our minds take shortcuts that magicians cleverly manipulate. Why haven’t we evolved to see through magic tricks? What role does survival play in shaping how we perceive the world?

What happens when you don’t notice changes right in front of you? We explore how magicians, like scientists, seek to understand the limits of human cognition. From change blindness to attentional blindness, we discuss how magic tricks exploit cognitive gaps. How does humor help magicians distract an audience? What can neuroscience learn from the study of stage magic?

We also examine the ethical questions surrounding magic and deception. Should magicians expose fraudulent psychics who exploit belief? Can illusions help teach critical thinking? Plus, learn where the rabbit coming out of the top hat came from and other magic lore.

The most populous city in Israel is a holy place for Christians, Jews and Muslims. And claims to its historic sites are the subject of furious dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.

The documentary sheds light on the political and religious background to the conflict over Jerusalem and places the current events in their historical context. Those involved have their say and experts comment on the current situation. Hamas named its 7 October terrorist attack on Israel ‘Operation Al-Aqsa Flood’ in reference to the famous Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.
In doing so, the Islamists are once again focusing global attention on the Holy City. Both sides lay claim to the Temple Mount, a place of religious significance for both communities. This is why Jerusalem has always been at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation. Middle East experts agree on one point: without a solution for Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim as the capital of their state, or possible future state, this conflict will not be resolved.
The documentary, which was made after 7 October, investigates one of the most profound conflicts of our time. It explores invisible borders, sheds light on the failed UN partition plan and tells of the eternal battle for the holy sites on Temple Mount. The film depicts a city where people co-exist without hatred, where a modern ‘start-up nation’ rubs shoulders with ancient culture - and where hope has not yet been completely extinguished.

The stadium’s latest $560M renovation–from the concession stands to the seating bowl–helped save it from demolition after Hurricane Katrina. NFL games have increasingly become more expensive with the addition of amenities like luxury field suites and club lounges, but all of these redesigns are done in order to increase revenue and efficiency. WSJ spoke with the architect behind the Superdome’s plan, who explains how stadium design is evolving to create more revenue streams.

ABSTRACT
There’s no such thing as the perfect programming language. I’m sorry, but there isn’t, and I’ll explain why.

On the other hand, if you were set the task of designing the perfect language, how close could you get, how would you go about it, and what would it look like in the end? We’re going to explore this problem space with a tour along the bleeding edge of modern language design, giving you some insight into what’s already out there, what tradeoffs each new idea comes with, and what sort of tools you might be working with in a future where programming is slightly less awful than it is today.

As today’s story explores, the DOGE teen is a former denizen of ‘,’ an archipelago of Discord and Telegram chat channels that function as a kind of distributed cybercriminal social network for facilitating instant collaboration.Since President Trump’s second inauguration, Musk’s DOGE team has gained access to a truly staggering amount of personal and sensitive data on American citizens, moving quickly to seize control over databases at the , the Office of Personnel Management, the , and the Department of Health and Human Resources, among others. first reported on Feb. 2 that one of the technologists on Musk’s crew is a 19-year-old high school graduate named , who reportedly goes by the nickname “Big Balls” online. One of the companies Coristine founded, , was set up in 2021, when he would have been around 16 years old.“Tesla.Sexy LLC controls dozens of web domains, including at least two Russian-registered domains,”  reported. “One of those domains, which is still active, offers a service called Helfie, which is an AI bot for Discord servers targeting the Russian market. While the operation of a Russian website would not violate US sanctions preventing Americans doing business with Russian companies, it could potentially be a factor in a security clearance review.”Mr. Coristine has not responded to requests for comment. In a follow-up story this week,  found that someone using a Telegram handle tied to Coristine solicited a DDoS-for-hire service in 2022, and that he worked for a short time at a company that specializes in protecting customers from DDoS attacks.A profile photo from Coristine’s WhatsApp account.Internet routing records show that Coristine runs an Internet service provider called  (AS400495). Also known as “,” Packetware currently hosts tesla[.]sexy and diamondcdn[.]com, among other domains.DiamondCDN was advertised and claimed by someone who used the nickname “” on several Com-based Discord channels over the years. A review of chat logs from some of those channels show other members frequently referred to Rivage as “Edward.”From late 2020 to late 2024, Rivage’s conversations would show up in multiple Com chat servers that are closely monitored by security companies. In November 2022, Rivage could be seen requesting recommendations for a reliable and powerful DDoS-for-hire service.Rivage made that request in the cybercrime channel “,” a core Com hub where users could buy and sell attack services. Dstat’s website dstat[.]cc was seized in 2024 as part of “Operation PowerOFF,” an international law enforcement action against DDoS services.Coristine’s LinkedIn profile said that in 2022 he worked at an anti-DDoS company called , which  generously described as a “network monitoring firm known for hiring reformed blackhat hackers.”  wrote:“At Path Network, Coristine worked as a systems engineer from April to June of 2022, according to his now-deleted LinkedIn résumé. Path has at times listed as employees , also known as Cosmo the God, a well-known former cybercriminal and member of the hacker group UGNazis, as well as Matthew Flannery, an Australian convicted hacker whom police allege was a member of the hacker group LulzSec. It’s unclear whether Coristine worked at Path concurrently with those hackers, and WIRED found no evidence that either Coristine or other Path employees engaged in illegal activity while at the company.”The other founder of BackConnect Security LLC was , a Georgia man who pleaded guilty in 2020 to paying a DDoS-for-hire service to launch attacks against others.The aforementioned Path employee Eric Taylor pleaded guilty in 2017 to charges including an attack on our home in 2013. Taylor was among several men involved in making a false report to my local police department about a supposed hostage situation at our residence in Virginia. In response, a heavily-armed police force surrounded my home and put me in handcuffs at gunpoint before the police realized it was all a dangerous hoax known as “swatting.”CosmoTheGod rocketed to Internet infamy in 2013 when he and a number of other hackers set up the Web site exposed[dot]su, which “doxed” dozens of public officials and celebrities by publishing the address, Social Security numbers and other personal information on the former First Lady Michelle Obama, the then-director of the FBI and the U.S. attorney general, among others. The group also swatted many of the people they doxed. noted that Coristine only worked at Path for a few months in 2022, but the story didn’t mention why his tenure was so short. A screenshot shared on the website pathtruths.com includes a snippet of conversations in June 2022 between Path employees discussing Coristine’s firing.According to that record, Path founder Marshal Webb dismissed Coristine for leaking internal documents to a competitor. Not long after Coristine’s termination, someone leaked an abundance of internal Path documents and conversations. Among other things, those chats revealed that one of Path’s technicians was a Canadian man named  who was convicted in 2017 of perpetrating dozens of swatting attacks and fake bomb threats — including at least two attempts against our home in 2014.A snippet of text from an internal Path chat room, wherein members discuss the reason for Coristine’s termination: Allegedly, leaking internal company information. Source: Pathtruths.com.On May 11, 2024, Rivage posted on a Discord channel for a DDoS protection service that is chiefly marketed to members of The Com. Rivage expressed frustration with his time spent on Com-based communities, suggesting that its profitability had been oversold.“I don’t think there’s a lot of money to be made in the com,” Rivage lamented. “I’m not buying Heztner [servers] to set up some com VPN.”Rivage largely stopped posting messages on Com channels after that.  reports that Coristine subsequently spent three months last summer working at , Elon Musk’s brain implant startup.The trouble with all this is that even if someone sincerely intends to exit The Com after years of consorting with cybercriminals, they are often still subject to personal attacks, harassment and hacking long after they have left the scene.That’s because a huge part of Com culture involves harassing, swatting and hacking other members of the community. These internecine attacks are often for financial gain, but just as frequently they are perpetrated by cybercrime groups to exact retribution from or assert dominance over rival gangs.Experts say it is extremely difficult for former members of violent street gangs to gain a security clearance needed to view sensitive or classified information held by the U.S. government. That’s because ex-gang members are highly susceptible to extortion and coercion from current members of the same gang, and that alone presents an unacceptable security risk for intelligence agencies.And make no mistake: The Com is the English-language cybercriminal hacking equivalent of a violent street gang. KrebsOnSecurity has published numerous stories detailing how feuds within the community periodically spill over into real-world violence.When Coristine’s name surfaced in ‘s report this week, members of The Com immediately took notice. In the following segment from a February 5, 2025 chat in a Com-affiliated hosting provider, members criticized Rivage’s skills, and discussed harassing his family and notifying authorities about incriminating accusations that may or may not be true.2025-02-05 16:29:44 UTC vperked#0 they got this nigga on indiatimes man

2025-02-05 16:35:19 UTC chainofcommand#0 i dont think they’ll care tbhGiven the speed with which Musk’s DOGE team was allowed access to such critical government databases, it strains credulity that Coristine could have been properly cleared beforehand. After all, he’d recently been dismissed from a job for allegedly leaking internal company information to outsiders.According to the national security adjudication guidelines (PDF) released by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), eligibility determinations take into account a person’s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, discretion, character, honesty, judgment, and ability to protect classified information.The DNI policy further states that “eligibility for covered individuals shall be granted only when facts and circumstances indicate that eligibility is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States, and any doubt shall be resolved in favor of national security.”On Thursday, 25-year-old DOGE staff member  resigned after being linked to a deleted social media account that advocated racism and eugenics. Elez resigned after asked the White House about his connection to the account.“Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,” the account posted in July. “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity,” the account wrote on X in September. “Normalize Indian hate,” the account wrote the same month, in reference to a post noting the prevalence of people from India in Silicon Valley.Elez’s resignation came a day after the Department of Justice agreed to limit the number of DOGE employees who have access to federal payment systems. The DOJ said access would be limited to two people, Elez and , the CEO of a company called Cloud Software Group.Earlier today, Musk said he planned to rehire Elez after  and  reportedly endorsed the idea. Speaking at The White House today, Trump said he wasn’t concerned about the security of personal information and other data accessed by DOGE, adding that he was “very proud of the job that this group of young people” are doing.A White House official told on Wednesday that Musk and his engineers have appropriate security clearances and are operating in “full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities.”reports Trump added that his administration’s cost-cutting efforts would soon turn to the Education Department and the Pentagon, “where he suggested without evidence that there could be ‘trillions’ of dollars in wasted spending within the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in fiscal year 2024.”GOP leaders in the Republican-controlled House and Senate have largely shrugged about Musk’s ongoing efforts to seize control over federal databases, dismantle agencies mandated by Congress, freeze federal spending on a range of already-appropriated government programs, and threaten workers with layoffs.Meanwhile, multiple parties have sued to stop DOGE’s activities. ABC News says a federal judge was to rule today on whether DOGE should be blocked from accessing Department of Labor records, following a lawsuit alleging Musk’s team sought to illegally access highly sensitive data, including medical information, from the federal government.At least 13 state attorneys general say they plan to file a lawsuit to stop DOGE from accessing federal payment systems containing Americans’ sensitive personal information, reports.Reuters reported Thursday that the U.S. Treasury Department had agreed not to give Musk’s team access to its payment systems while a judge is hearing arguments in a lawsuit by employee unions and retirees alleging Musk illegally searched those records.writes that The Department of Education (DoE) was sued Friday by a California student association demanding an “immediate stop” to DOGE’s “unlawfully” digging through student loan data to potentially dismantle the DoE.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Andrew’s biggest fear in the field</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4ZKPlQkODY</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/o4ZKPlQkODY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 01:35:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google&apos;s 7-Year Slog To Improve Chrome Extensions Still Hasn&apos;t Satisfied Developers</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/02/07/2246202/googles-7-year-slog-to-improve-chrome-extensions-still-hasnt-satisfied-developers?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 01:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Register's Thomas Claburn reports: Google's overhaul of Chrome's extension architecture continues to pose problems for developers of ad blockers, content filters, and privacy tools. [...] While Google's desire to improve the security, privacy, and performance of the Chrome extension platform is reasonable, its approach -- which focuses on code and permissions more than human oversight -- remains a work-in-progress that has left extension developers frustrated.
 
Alexei Miagkov, senior staff technology at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who oversees the organization's Privacy Badger extension, told The Register, "Making extensions under MV3 is much harder than making extensions under MV2. That's just a fact. They made things harder to build and more confusing." Miagkov said with Privacy Badger the problem has been the slowness with which Google addresses gaps in the MV3 platform. "It feels like MV3 is here and the web extensions team at Google is in no rush to fix the frayed ends, to fix what's missing or what's broken still." According to Google's documentation, "There are currently no open issues considered a critical platform gap," and various issues have been addressed through the addition of new API capabilities.
 
Miagkov described an unresolved problem that means Privacy Badger is unable to strip Google tracking redirects on Google sites. "We can't do it the correct way because when Google engineers design the [chrome.declarativeNetRequest API], they fail to think of this scenario," he said. "We can do a redirect to get rid of the tracking, but it ends up being a broken redirect for a lot of URLs. Basically, if the URL has any kind of query string parameters -- the question mark and anything beyond that -- we will break the link." Miagkov said a Chrome developer relations engineer had helped identify a workaround, but it's not great. Miagkov thinks these problems are of Google's own making -- the company changed the rules and has been slow to write the new ones. "It was completely predictable because they moved the ability to fix things from extensions to themselves," he said. "And now they need to fix things and they're not doing it."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The state of homelab tech (2025) (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/79</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/79/changelog--friends-79.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Techno Tim joins Adam to catch up on the state of Homelab for 2025, the state of AI at home and on-prem (AI Homelab) and where that’s heading, building a creator PC, choosing the parts for your build, GPU availability, Windows being user hostile, and why Tim is happy to be using Windows, Mac AND Linux.Changelog++ members save 8 minutes on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

José Andrés discovers that his great-great-grandmother, Oracia, was abandoned as a child and left to nuns. Most abandoned children at that time did not fare well, but Oracia beat the odds, being adopted by a mystery couple who set her up with financial stability. She would later marry, start a family -- and open a bakery -- an ambition that chef José shares!

Twice named one of Time Magazine’s “100 Most Influential People” and awarded “Outstanding Chef” and “Humanitarian of the Year” by the James Beard Foundation, José Andrés is an internationally recognized humanitarian, culinary innovator, New York Times bestselling author, educator, Emmy-winning television personality, and owner of the award-winning José Andrés Group, which operates nearly 40 restaurants in the US and beyond. In 2010, Andrés founded World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit organization that is first to the frontlines of crises. Andrés’ many distinctions included the 2015 National Humanities Medal, the 2017 Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Association of Culinary Professionals, and the Princess of Asturias Foundation’s 2021 Concordia Prize for his humanitarian work. In 2023, Andrés founded the Global Food Institute at George Washington University in Washington DC.

A heroine, forgotten by history, who fearlessly saved Jewish lives. The name of her husband Oskar Schindler became synonymous with acts of compassion and humanity in the Nazi era. But what role did his wife Emilie Schindler play?

Filmmaker Annette Baumeister tells the story of Emilie Schindler, who protected people without attracting much attention. After the war, Emilie was abandoned by her husband and forgotten by the world. 

Emilie Pelzl was born in the Sudetenland in 1907. From an early age, she worked on her parents' farm and cared for relatives. At the age of 20, she fell in love with the charming Oskar Schindler. Although he was considered a heartbreaker, she married him. Oskar had affairs and squandered the dowry, but Emilie stuck by him. During World War Two, the Schindlers ran factories and employed Jewish workers - saving many of them from the death camps.

In this documentary, Emilie Schindler's Argentinian carer Leandro Coseforti, her niece Traude Ferrari, and historians all describe a forgotten heroine. Annette Baumeister sensitively reconstructs Emilie Schindler's life, bringing her out of her husband's shadow. 

The film draws a picture of a woman who risked her life to help others. By procuring food and medicine for those in need, she helped to rescue many Jewish people right under the noses of the SS.

Fingerprints have long been known to be completely unique. They also don’t change their pattern over your lifetime, making them an extremely useful biometric for identification. Their uniqueness largely comes from how they form in the womb: as waves of skin cells growing in random patterns of ridges under the top layer of skin in our hands and feet.

Fingerprints are so unique that it is considered impossible to match two different fingerprints from the same person — the only way to know for sure is to match a fingerprint to the exact finger. But a new AI tool developed by students at Columbia University says there are more similarities in intra-person, or same person, fingerprints than we’ve previously known.

Critics have labeled the legislation the "Snooper's Charter," as it authorizes law enforcement to compel assistance from companies when needed to collect evidence.An Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the revelation, though the law actually makes it a criminal offense to reveal that the government even made such a demand. Likewise, the Home Office told the publication that its policy was not to discuss any technical demands. "We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices," a spokesman said.One of the people briefed on the situation, a consultant advising the United States on encryption matters, said Apple would be barred from warning its users that its most advanced encryption no longer provided full security. The person deemed it shocking that the UK government was demanding Apple's help to spy on non-British users without their governments' knowledge. A former White House security adviser confirmed the existence of the British order.Apple May Drop UK iCloud Services Over Secret Encryption Access OrderApple is likely to stop offering encrypted storage in the UK, rather than break the security promises it made to its users, people familiar with the matter told the publication. However, that would not affect the UK order for backdoor access to the service in other countries, including the United States. Apple has previously said it would consider pulling services such as FaceTime and iMessage from the UK rather than compromise future security.The order would compromise Apple's Advanced Data Protection, which the company launched in 2022. The feature gives users the option to end-to-end encrypt many additional iCloud data categories, including Photos, Notes, Voice Memos, Messages backups, device backups, and more, making their data inaccessible to anyone else – including Apple.Google has enforced default encryption for Android phone backups since 2018. When asked by  whether any government had requested a backdoor, Google spokesman Ed Fernandez did not provide a direct answer but suggested none exist: "Google cannot access Android end-to-end encrypted backup data, even with a legal order," he stated.The IPA was updated in 2023 to allow the Home Office to outlaw certain encrypted services using a technical capability notice. Apple at the time called the then proposed amendments "an unprecedented overreach by the government," saying that if the update was enacted, "the UK could attempt to secretly veto new user protections globally preventing us from ever offering them to customers."Apple CEO Tim Cook has consistently insisted that providing back-door access past its encryption for authorities would open the door for "bad guys" to gain access to its users' data. Cyber security experts agree that it would only be a matter of time before bad actors discover such a point of entry. Apple's stance was enhanced in 2016 when it successfully fought a US order to unlock the iPhone of a shooter in San Bernardino, California.US law enforcement's longstanding objections to encryption have recently taken a backseat to concerns over large-scale cyber intrusions attributed to Chinese state-backed hackers. The attackers infiltrated major telecommunications providers, granting them unfettered access to private phone calls. During a December press conference alongside FBI officials, a Department of Homeland Security representative cautioned Americans against assuming traditional phone networks offer privacy, instead advising them to use encrypted communication whenever feasible.That same month, the FBI, National Security Agency, and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a joint advisory detailing numerous countermeasures against the Chinese cyber campaign. Among their recommendations: "Ensure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible."In a statement, privacy campaigner Big Brother Watch said: "This misguided attempt at tackling crime and terrorism will not make the UK safer, but it will erode the fundamental rights and civil liberties of the entire population."Note: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Political News forum.

And Bashlykov's warnings seemingly landed on deaf ears, with authors alleging that evidence showed Meta chose to instead hide its torrenting as best it could while downloading and seeding terabytes of data from multiple shadow libraries as recently as April 2024.Meta allegedly concealed seedingSupposedly, Meta tried to conceal the seeding by not using Facebook servers while downloading the dataset to "avoid" the "risk" of anyone "tracing back the seeder/downloader" from Facebook servers, an internal message from Meta researcher Frank Zhang said, while describing the work as being in "stealth mode." Meta also allegedly modified settings "so that the smallest amount of seeding possible could occur," a Meta executive in charge of project management, Michael Clark, said in a deposition.Now that new information has come to light, authors claim that Meta staff involved in the decision to torrent LibGen must be deposed again because the new facts allegedly "contradict prior deposition testimony."Mark Zuckerberg, for example, claimed to have no involvement in decisions to use LibGen to train AI models. But unredacted messages show the "decision to use LibGen occurred" after "a prior escalation to MZ," authors alleged.Meta did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment and has maintained throughout the litigation that AI training on LibGen was "fair use."However, Meta has previously addressed its torrenting in a motion to dismiss filed last month, telling the court that "plaintiffs do not plead a single instance in which any part of any book was, in fact, downloaded by a third party from Meta via torrent, much less that Plaintiffs’ books were somehow distributed by Meta."While Meta may be confident in its legal strategy despite the new torrenting wrinkle, the social media company has seemingly complicated its case by allowing authors to expand the distribution theory that's key to winning a direct copyright infringement claim beyond just claiming that Meta's AI outputs unlawfully distributed their works.As limited discovery on Meta's seeding now proceeds, Meta is not fighting the seeding aspect of the direct copyright infringement claim at this time, telling the court that it plans to "set... the record straight and debunk... this meritless allegation on summary judgment."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why China’s Luxury Boom Is Over</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waY0UMiSOgI</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/waY0UMiSOgI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 09:01:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The global luxury market has been booming for more than a decade, pushing up the values of companies such as LVMH and Kering.

Between 1947 and 1967, black-owned homes in Birmingham, Alabama were bombed over 50 times. Homes on Center Street were targeted so often, the neighborhood became known as ‘Dynamite Hill.’ What happened on Center Street is a scar on American history, but the voices of Dynamite Hill speak with strength and grace about how they faced unimaginable hatred, with one repeated refrain: “I’m still here.”

Predestination is ultimate destiny, fate. It is the claim by some religions that a Supreme Being, whether a personal God or a cosmic force, has determined for individual lives their ultimate course. When God foreordains, whether for salvation or for damnation, nothing can resist. Is this fair? Does this make sense? Would you like such a God?

The conflict centers on a proposed patch enabling Rust-written device drivers to access the kernel's DMA API, which Hellwig strongly opposed. While the dispute isn't about Rust itself, Hellwig argues that maintaining cross-language codebases severely compromises Linux's integrated nature. From a report: "Don't force me to deal with your shiny language of the day," he [Hellwig] wrote. "Maintaining multi-language projects is a pain I have no interest in dealing with. If you want to use something that's not C, be that assembly or Rust, you write to C interfaces and deal with the impedance mismatch yourself as far as I'm concerned." This resistance follows the September departure of Microsoft engineer Wedson Almeida Filho from the Rust for Linux project, citing "nontechnical nonsense."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: An API that takes a URL and returns a file with browser screenshots</title><link>https://github.com/US-Artificial-Intelligence/scraper</link><author>gkamer8</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Feb 2025 18:48:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: SQLite disk page explorer</title><link>https://github.com/QuadrupleA/sqlite-page-explorer</link><author>QuadrupleA</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Feb 2025 18:40:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google finally shipped some fire…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9xbh9LUYn0</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/k9xbh9LUYn0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Feb 2025 18:26:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Deploy your app without complexity using Sevalla http://bit.ly/4hDju8W

Well we can! Thanks to the extraordinary work of the artist hans Holbein the Younger.

Professor Suzannah Lipscomb goes to Buckingham Palace to enter the gallery of the Royal Collection where a brilliant exhibition of Hans Holbein’s works takes us to the very heart of life in the Tudor court - meeting the men and women who witnessed and changed history, Anne Boleyn, Thomas More, Jane Seymour.  Thanks to the amazingly characterful drawings of Hans Holbein the Younger we can look them in the eye, weigh them up, consider their motives. 

Suzannah explores the movers and shakers of Henry VIII’s inner circle - including one very special Holbein portrait that could be of Anne Boleyn herself, captured in a reflective and intimate moment. Experts have long debated whether it could be Anne at the time she was queen.  Now Suzannah and Royal Collections curator Kate Heard discuss the evidence and reach a thrilling conclusion. 

And there are other stars of the Tudor world here too - Thomas More, the great humanist, lawyer and politician; Thomas Wyatt, the mercurial diplomat ; as well as lesser known people like Frances De Vere, a dynamic woman captured on paper by Holbein’s genius.

This policy can, at times, keep people from going home many days after they are medically ready for discharge. One healthcare company in the Philippines says it’s just following the law.

Using modern genetic techniques, they’re extracting ancient genetic material from museum exhibits. Do their efforts represent hope for the future of the natural world? Or is science playing God?

Findings in the thawed permafrost of Siberia have made it possible to reconstruct the DNA of mammoths. Researchers are now experimenting with inserting genes related to the ability to resist cold temperatures into the Asian elephant, which is related to the mammoth. The animals thus created could survive in the steppes of Siberia and Alaska. 

In Australia, scientists have managed to extract the genetic material of marsupial wolves from preserved embryos in museums. The predator’s genes are replicated in the lab and implanted into the related marsupial mouse - in a bid to bring the extinct creature back to life. 

And biotechnology could also help white rhinos in Africa: Researchers in Berlin are fertilizing eggs from the last two living females with sperm from deceased males frozen and preserved for decades. 

However, these practices are also attracting criticism. Biology researchers question the usefulness of revived species for natural habitats. They fear that the excitement surrounding the idea of bringing back extinct species could distract people from the many problems that cause animals to disappear, in the first place. Are some scientists playing God - with unforeseeable consequences for the environment?

Is God, if there is a God, the ‘God of History’? Does God make specific interventions in the course of human events to ensure that God’s purpose be fulfilled, for nations as well as for individuals? Or did God so set the laws of nature before the foundation of the world such that God’s goals would be achieved without God’s special, active interventions?

In a  leaderboard, updates happen almost instantly:A player’s score changes (e.g., after scoring a point or defeating an opponent).The system updates that player’s rank immediately.Other players can see the updated position without waiting or refreshing.This real-time aspect makes the user experience more dynamic and engaging. However, it also introduces significant , such as:Efficiently retrieving Top-N players (e.g., Top 10 or Top 100).Allowing players to quickly find their own rank without scanning the entire leaderboard.In this article, we will explore how to design a , , and  that can support above queries and enhance the user experience.Before diving into the design, lets clearly define the functional and non-functional requirements of our real-time gaming leaderboard..: Display top N players (e.g., top 10, top 100) on the leaderboard and update it in real-time.: Allow a player to query their current rank without scanning the entire leaderboard. Provide the ability to retrieve a “slice” of the leaderboard around a specific player (e.g., ranks 45 to 55 if the player is rank 50). Players can view past game scores and historical leaderboards for previous matches.Non-Functional Requirements Score changes should reflect immediately in the leaderboard.: Leaderboard queries should return the results in milliseconds.: System should support thousands of concurrent players submitting scores and fetching rankings.Approach to Designing the SystemThe most challenging aspects of building a real-time leaderboard is . Choosing the right storage system is critical to ensuring that queries can be executed efficiently without performance bottlenecks.To simplify the design process, we will follow below approach:Clearly define the input/output structure of leaderboard queries and updates.Define the High-Level Architecture: Identify core system components and their interactions.Choose the appropriate storage model optimized for fast leaderboard lookups and real-time updates.To support real-time leaderboard operations, we define a set of  that allow players to update scores, retrieve rankings, and query nearby ranks efficiently.Updates a player's score incrementally: POST /leaderboard/score/update{
  "playerId": "player123",
  "scoreDelta": 50
}We will use relative score updates () rather than absolute updates.{
  "playerId": "player123",
  "updatedScore": 1000,
  "currentRank": 10
}Retrieves the top-N players from the leaderboard, ranked by their scores.: GET /leaderboard/top?n=10:  = number of top players to fetch (default 10, max 100, etc.){
  "leaderboardId": "global",

  ]
}Allows a player to retrieve their current rank without scanning the entire leaderboard.: GET /leaderboard/rank/{playerId}{
  "playerId": "player123",
  "score": 1000,
  "rank": 10
}Retrieves players ranked around a given player, allowing for comparison with competitors of similar skill levels.: GET /leaderboard/nearby/{playerId}?range=5:  indicates how many ranks above and below to fetch (e.g., 5 above, 5 below).{
  "playerId": "player123",

The Rwandan government mobilized the country’s Hutu population to attack members of the Tutsi minority and anyone who opposed. In just 100 days, around one million people were killed. 
 
30 years after the genocide, Rwandans are trying to move forward. In "reconciliation villages", convicted perpetrators, who have been released from prison, survivors of the genocide and their children live side by side and try to deal with the past.

WSJ’s Jonathan Cheng traveled to the world’s largest wholesale market called the Yiwu International Trade Market to see how these products are making their way into U.S. markets. If you’ve ever bought anything on Temu or Shein, there’s a good chance it came from this bazaar near China’s east coast, which is close to huge ports in Shanghai and Ningbo. 

WSJ explores why this market in China, the center point of global wholesale trade, has found itself in the U.S. government’s crosshairs.

The reason, we suspect, is because folks often forget the order of arrays that come out. We know that `X_train` comes first, but then what? Is it `y_train` or `X_test`? This video explains the reasoning and also does a deep dive on the implementation.

The move has been criticized as an attempt to either stall or water down legal action against the database goliath over the programming language's name. Deno Land, the outfit behind the Deno JavaScript runtime, filed a petition with the USPTO back in November in an effort to make the trademarked term available to the JavaScript community. This legal effort is led by Node.js creator and Deno Land CEO Ryan Dahl, summarized on the JavaScript.tm website, and supported by more than 16,000 members of the JavaScript community. It aims to remove the fear of an Oracle lawsuit for using the term "JavaScript" in a conference title or business venture.
 
"Programmers working with JavaScript have formed innumerable community organizations," the website explains. "These organizations, like the standards bodies, have been forced to painstakingly avoid naming the programming language they are built around -- for example, JSConf. Sadly, without risking a legal trademark challenge against Oracle, there can be no 'JavaScript Conference' nor a 'JavaScript Specification.' The world's most popular programming language cannot even have a conference in its name." [...] In the initial trademark complaint, Deno Land makes three arguments to invalidate Oracle's ownership of "JavaScript." The biz claims that JavaScript has become a generic term; that Oracle committed fraud in 2019 when it applied to renew its trademark; and that Oracle has abandoned its trademark because it does not offer JavaScript products or services.
 
Oracle's motion on Monday focuses on the dismissal of the fraud claim, while arguing that it expects to prevail on the other two claims, citing corporate use of the trademarked term "in connection with a variety of offerings, including its JavaScript Extension Toolkit as well as developer's guides and educational resources, and also that relevant consumers do not perceive JavaScript as a generic term." The fraud claim follows from Deno Land's assertion that the material Oracle submitted in support of its trademark renewal application has nothing to do with any Oracle product. "Oracle, through its attorney, submitted specimens showing screen captures of the Node.js website, a project created by Ryan Dahl, Petitioner's Chief Executive Officer," the trademark cancellation petition says. "Node.js is not affiliated with Oracle, and the use of screen captures of the 'nodejs.org' website as a specimen did not show any use of the mark by Oracle or on behalf of Oracle."
 
Oracle contends that in fact it submitted two specimens to the USPTO -- a screenshot from the Node.js website and another from its own Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit. And this, among other reasons, invalidates the fraud claim, Big Red's attorneys contend. "Where, as here, Registrant 'provided the USPTO with [two specimens]' at least one of which shows use of the mark in commerce, Petitioner cannot plausibly allege that the inclusion of a second, purportedly defective specimen, was material," Oracle's motion argues, adding that no evidence of fraudulent intent has been presented. Beyond asking the court to toss the fraud claim, Oracle has requested an additional thirty days to respond to the other two claims.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Sports Teams Can Learn from Tiktok Star Josh Richards | The Deal</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDkTJUzRod0</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uDkTJUzRod0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 23:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of The Deal, Alex Rodriguez and Jason Kelly sit with entrepreneur Josh Richards to discuss his social media empire.

Uncover new archaeological evidence rewriting our understanding of the Dark Ages in 5th- and 6th-century Britain that might also explain the legend of King Arthur. [Originally aired in 2019]

After four centuries of occupation and leadership, the Romans left Britain in 410 AD and the island’s fate was left hanging in the balance. History teaches that in the 5th century, the country descended into a tumultuous and violent period known as the Dark Ages, leaving the nation vulnerable to invading Angle and Saxon hordes from northern Europe. With a nation divided, a great leader known as King Arthur emerged, uniting the lawless lands to fight off invaders – or at least that’s what the fragmentary historical texts suggest. The truth is, no one really knows what happened, and this pivotal moment in history has been shrouded in mystery – until now.

The defense is commonly known as MotW, short for Mark of the Web. It works by placing a “Zone.Identifier” tag on all files downloaded from the Internet or from a networked share. This tag, a type of NTFS Alternate Data Stream and in the form of a ZoneID=3, subjects the file to additional scrutiny from Windows Defender SmartScreen and restrictions on how or when it can be executed.There’s an archive in my archiveThe 7-Zip vulnerability allowed the Russian cybercrime group to bypass those protections. Exploits worked by embedding an executable file within an archive and then embedding the archive into another archive. While the outer archive carried the MotW tag, the inner one did not. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-0411, was fixed with the release of version 24.09 in late November.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Build software that lasts!

For a very long time, it was the sensible default option. Around 2016, I used the Ubuntu GNOME flavor, and after they ditched the Unity desktop environment, GNOME became the default option. 

I was really happy with it, both for work and personal computing needs. Estonian ID card software was also officially supported on Ubuntu, which made Ubuntu a good choice for family members. 

But then something changed. Ounapuu recounts how Ubuntu's bi-annual long-term support releases consistently broke functionality, from minor interface glitches to catastrophic system failures that left computers unresponsive. His breaking point came after multiple problematic upgrades affecting family members' computers, including one that rendered a laptop completely unusable during an upgrade from Ubuntu 20.04 to 22.04. Another incident left a relative's system with broken Firefox shortcuts and duplicate status bar icons after updating Lubuntu 18.04. 

Canonical's aggressive push of Snap packages has drawn particular criticism. The forced migration of system components from traditional Debian packages to Snaps resulted in compatibility issues, broken desktop shortcuts, and government ID card authentication failures. In one instance, he writes, a Snap-related bug in the GNOME desktop environment severely disrupted workplace productivity, requiring multiple system restarts to resolve. The author has since switched to Fedora, praising its implementation of Flatpak as a superior alternative to Snaps.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tell HN: Cloudflare is blocking Pale Moon and other non-mainstream browsers</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42953508</link><author>Hold-And-Modify</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 19:08:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello.Cloudflare's Browser Intergrity Check/Verification/Challenge feature used by many websites, is denying access to users of non-mainstream browsers like Pale Moon.Users reports began on January 31:This situation occurs at least once a year, and there is no easy way to contact Cloudflare.

Following the collapse of Germany’s governing coalition in the fall, early parliamentary elections are now due to take place at the end of February. DW reporters Oxana Evdokimova and Carolina Machhaus  traveled around Germany, speaking to people who are worried about what the future holds, but who are also tackling and helping to solve problems. According to one survey, the cost of living and the gap between rich and poor are particularly problematic in Germany. Food prices, for example, have risen by around a third since 2020.. Munich food bank founder Hannelore Kiethe says that demand has been rising ever since its founding. Affordable housing is another issue that concerns people in Germany, especially in the big cities. Christa Lippmann has founded a housing project for single women, with success. Dietmar Kibbel is concerned that Germany does not have enough skilled workers to get the economy moving again and is involved in a program for applicants to qualify as train drivers within a year — a highly skilled profession and one that is highly in demand across the country. It is an opportunity for Abdullah Alyaqub, who fled his home country of Syria ten years ago and hopes that his new job will give him more financial security.

responses. Along the way I learned that classifying qualitative data is not
easy but I gave it my best shot. I ended up building a custom
tool to make it faster to categorize
everything.As with all of my surveys the methodology isn’t particularly scientific. I just
posted the survey to Mastodon and Twitter, ran it for a couple of days, and got
answers from whoever happened to see it and felt like responding.Here are the top categories of frustrations!I think it’s worth keeping in mind while reading these comments that40% of people answering this survey have been using the terminal for 95% of people answering the survey have been using the terminal for at least 4 yearsThese comments aren’t coming from total beginners.Here are the categories of frustrations! The number in brackets is the number
of people with that frustration. I’m mostly writing this up for myself because
I’m trying to write a zine about the terminal and I wanted to get a sense for
what people are having trouble with.People talked about struggles remembering:the syntax for CLI tools like awk, jq, sed, etckeyboard shortcuts for tmux, text editing, etcThere are just so many little “trivia” details to remember for full
functionality. Even after all these years I’ll sometimes forget where it’s 2
or 1 for stderr, or forget which is which for  and .switching terminals is hard (91)People talked about struggling with switching systems (for example home/work
computer or when SSHing) and running into:OS differences in keyboard shortcuts (like Linux vs Mac)systems which don’t have their preferred text editor (“no vim” or “only vim”)different versions of the same command (like Mac OS grep vs GNU grep)a shell they aren’t used to (“the subtle differences between zsh and bash”)as well as differences inside the same system like pagers being not consistent
with each other (git diff pagers, other pagers).I got used to fish and vi mode which are not available when I ssh into
servers, containers.Lots of problems with color, like:programs setting colors that are unreadable with a light background colorfinding a colorscheme they like (and getting it to work consistently across different apps)color not working inside several layers of SSH/tmux/etcnot wanting color at all and struggling to turn it offThis comment felt relatable to me:Getting my terminal theme configured in a reasonable way between the terminal
emulator and fish (I did this years ago and remember it being tedious and
fiddly and now feel like I’m locked into my current theme because it works
and I dread touching any of that configuration ever again).Half of the comments on keyboard shortcuts were about how on Linux/Windows, the
keyboard shortcut to copy/paste in the terminal is different from in the rest
of the OS.Some other issues with keyboard shortcuts other than copy/paste:using  in a browser-based terminal and closing the windowthe terminal only supports a limited set of keyboard shortcuts (no
, no , no , lots of  shortcuts aren’t
possible like )the OS stopping you from using a terminal keyboard shortcut (like by default
Mac OS uses  for something else)issues using emacs in the terminalbackspace not working (2)other copy and paste issues (75)Aside from “the keyboard shortcut for copy and paste is different”, there were
a lot of OTHER issues with copy and paste, like:how tmux and the terminal emulator both do copy/paste in different waysdealing with many different clipboards (system clipboard, vim clipboard, the
“middle click” clipboard on Linux, tmux’s clipboard, etc) and potentially
synchronizing themrandom spaces added when copying from the terminalpasting multiline commands which automatically get run in a terrifying waywanting a way to copy text without using the mouseThere were lots of comments about this, which all came down to the same basic
complaint – it’s hard to discover useful tools or features! This comment kind of
summed it all up:How difficult it is to learn independently. Most of what I know is an
assorted collection of stuff I’ve been told by random people over the years.steep learning curve (44)A lot of comments about it generally having a steep learning curve. A couple of
example comments:After 15 years of using it, I’m not much faster than using it than I was 5 or
maybe even 10 years ago.That I know I could make my life easier by learning more about the shortcuts
and commands and configuring the terminal but I don’t spend the time because it
feels overwhelming.Some issues with shell history:history not being shared between terminal tabs (16)limits that are too short (4)history not being restored when terminal tabs are restoredlosing history because the terminal crashednot knowing how to search historyIt wasted a lot of time until I figured it out and still annoys me that
“history” on zsh has such a small buffer;  I have to type “history 0” to get
any useful length of history.documentation being generally opaquelack of examples in man pagesprograms which don’t have man pagesHere’s a representative comment:Finding good examples and docs. Man pages often not enough, have to wade
through stack overflowA few issues with scrollback:programs printing out too much data making you lose scrollback historyresizing the terminal messes up the scrollbackGUI programs that you start in the background printing stuff out that gets in
the way of other programs’ outputsWhen resizing the terminal (in particular: making it narrower) leads to
broken rewrapping of the scrollback content because the commands formatted
their output based on the terminal window width.Lots of comments about how the terminal feels hampered by legacy decisions and
how users often end up needing to learn implementation details that feel very
esoteric. One example comment:Most of the legacy cruft, it would be great to have a green field
implementation of the CLI interface.Lots of complaints about POSIX shell scripting. There’s a general feeling that
shell scripting is difficult but also that switching to a different less
standard scripting language (fish, nushell, etc) brings its own problems.Shell scripting. My tolerance to ditch a shell script and go to a scripting
language is pretty low. It’s just too messy and powerful. Screwing up can be
costly so I don’t even bother.Some more issues that were mentioned at least 10 times:(31) inconsistent command line arguments: is it -h or help or –help?(24) keeping dotfiles in sync across different systems(23) performance (e.g. “my shell takes too long to start”)(20) window management (potentially with some combination of tmux tabs, terminal tabs, and multiple terminal windows. Where did that shell session go?)(17) generally feeling scared/uneasy (“The debilitating fear that I’m going

can’t do EVERYTHING in the terminal”Think I’ve found work arounds for most/all frustrationsI’m not going to make a lot of commentary on these results, but here are a
couple of categories that feel related to me:remembering syntax & history (often the thing you need to remember is something you’ve run before!)discoverability & the learning curve (the lack of discoverability is definitely a big part of what makes it hard to learn)“switching systems is hard” & “it feels outdated” (tools that haven’t really
changed in 30 or 40 years have many problems but they do tend to be always
 no matter what system you’re on, which is very useful and makes them
hard to stop using)Trying to categorize all these results in a reasonable way really gave me an
appreciation for social science researchers’ skills.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The South Korean Daewoo K2 rifle with firearms expert Jonathan Ferguson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoUYo2ihDmM</link><author>Royal Armouries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eoUYo2ihDmM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 16:08:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMX-XuiEkBi4-GDrYuniWg">Royal Armouries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As seen in Squid Game, this week Jonathan delves into the South Korean service rifle - the Daewoo K2.

To me personally, it feels unavoidable: I can’t look down at my phone or glance up at a TV without seeing  that makes me upset. And that’s really exhausting. But when outrage is everywhere, what can we do to keep it from getting to us?On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.Here to talk to us about fighting so-called outrage fatigue is Tanya Lewis, a senior editor covering health and medicine at .Tanya, thanks for joining us today. Thanks so much for having me. So you recently wrote about this phenomenon called “outrage fatigue.” Could you tell us what that is? Sure, so outrage fatigue is kind of an informal concept, which basically refers to repeatedly experiencing perceived moral transgressions and feeling fatigued by them. So what that basically means is just, you know, you see something, you’re outraged by it, and over time you just become kind of numb to it. Sounds relevant to [laughs], to many of our lives. What do researchers know about outrage in general? So outrage fatigue itself hasn’t been that well-studied, but outrage in general has been studied, and people have found that, actually, outrage can be useful. It actually can help you identify a problem and react to it. But it can also be harmful if you’re experiencing it all the time and become overwhelmed by it.There’s actually a recent study by William Brady, an assistant professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. He and his colleagues found that outrage actually helps misinformation spread more widely, especially online on social media. So the upshot of this is that when you have too much outrage, people can actually withdraw from public spaces or virtual places like social media. Yeah, and what is it about outrage that helps misinformation spread? So I think part of it is the fact that it’s more engaging. It, you know, activates your emotions, and so people are more primed to respond to that. As we all know, if you’ve ever spent time on social media and social networks, we always see the most kind of inflammatory content because that’s what gets retweets or clicks and the algorithms are amplifying that. Right, and more broadly, you know, what is it about the times we’re living in that makes outrage so hard to avoid? So we’re living in a particularly polarized time, which I think is not a surprise to anybody. If you have been online lately, on Twitter or Facebook or TikTok or any other social media, you’ve probably seen people yelling about something or other. And this just really has been accelerating, I guess, in the last few years because of our political polarization and other world events.As I was saying earlier some amount of outrage is actually normal and healthy, but studies have shown that the majority of outrage posts on social media are actually driven by a small minority of users who are very—you know, they feel very strongly about something, and that can actually turn other people off of participating in the conversation. Yeah, so social media is a big part of this, you know, both amplifying it and giving a platform for people who are feeling this outrage. Other than just making us feel bad, what does outrage fatigue do to a person? So the real danger is that we become apathetic, and if we’re exposed to something all the time—whether it’s through social media or even traditional news sources like cable TV—if it’s constantly telling us to be outraged, eventually we’re gonna be less responsive and we’re gonna kind of pull back. So instead of, like, channeling that outrage into something useful, many people sort of feel exhausted and burned out, and they just don’t want to take action at all.And this is actually a problem because politicians can take advantage of that and sort of manipulate people. As we’ve seen over the last few decades some of the big social issues like abortion, gay rights, critical race theory, these have all been used as kind of wedge issues to convince people to vote in ways that might be against their own self-interest because they’re just so outraged about this one particular issue. Yeah, so definitely worth avoiding. What can we do to accomplish that? Right. That was my question, too. You know, a couple of things: one is that we can just sort of limit how much media we consume. As somebody who is a member of the media, you know, this might sound strange, but I think if you’re feeling constantly overwhelmed and outraged by something, if you consume less of it, that’s probably a good thing.But it doesn’t mean you should totally sort of ignore what’s happening. When I talked to William Brady, he said that, you know, one of the ways you can kind of have an impact without just being overwhelmed is to get involved in local politics or local issues, you know, in your community because you can actually have a much greater impact on a local level, usually, than a national level anyway. So rather than just, like, retweeting that most outrageous post that you see, you know, it’s better to get involved with real people and kind of have a dialogue with them. Yeah, find some mutual aid groups ... Find stuff you can actually do when you’re not doomscrolling and hopefully [laughs] ... Do less of the doomscrolling, too. And did he have any advice for sort of recovering from outrage burnout once it’s hit you? Gosh, that is a good question. You know, it’s not something I specifically asked Dr. Brady about, but I think, just from my own experience, like I said, you know, pulling back a little bit from some of the media consumption and, you know, just maybe limiting yourself to checking the news a couple times a day instead of, like, every hour or, you know, getting those alerts on your phone all the time. If someone is posting stuff that makes you furious all the time, maybe don’t follow them [laughs]. And, yeah, get outside, get in nature—you know, the usual things that can kind of reset your brain and make you feel, you know, more calm. Yeah, maybe easier said than done, but really good advice. Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us, Tanya. Thanks so much. It’s always great being on here. That’s all for today’s episode. If you want to learn more about outrage fatigue, you can read Tanya’s full interview with Dr. Brady on ScientificAmerican.com.

In recent decades, Gassed was interpreted as a very yellow painting. But it didn’t always look like that. 

The yellow effect comes from a discoloured varnish from the 1970s, concealing Sargent’s intentions and skewing our interpretation of his work. Now, thanks to meticulous conservation efforts as part of IWM’s new Blavatnik Art, Film and Photography Galleries, Gassed and its meaning have been reborn.
 
Today we’re going to examine the history of Gassed, what it means, why it’s important, and how that has changed over 100 years on display.

ABSTRACT
Edge computing is not a new concept but in the past few years we're seeing powerful tools made more easily available at the edge.
This talk will go into what the edge is, why its increasing availability and adoption is exciting, and ways we can start incorporating the edge into our applications. [...]

By default, when someone uses command-line tools built into Go to download or install packages, requests are routed through the service. A description on the site says the proxy is provided by the Go team and “run by Google.”Since November 2021, the Go Module Mirror has been hosting a backdoored version of a widely used module, security firm Socket said Monday. The file uses “typosquatting,” a technique that gives malicious files names similar to widely used legitimate ones and plants them in popular repositories. In the event someone makes a typo or even a minor variation from the correct name when fetching a file with the command line, they land on the malicious file instead of the one they wanted. (A similar typosquatting scheme is common with domain names, too.)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The BEST thing about the M4 Sherman</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIOV8ey1Lrw</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tIOV8ey1Lrw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 12:01:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Cat’s Nine Lives Inspire a Way to Quell Quantum Errors</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-error</link><author>John Boyd</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjE1NDY3MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODk0NzY3OH0.hyWMjN77nXKClo7akyxT_W_D4MMmoDVBeCB3wvY99zo/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 12:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Antimony’s eight quantum states makes it harder for a qubit to flip]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: HN as TikTok, welcome to HN hell</title><link>https://hnhell.com/</link><author>sirobg</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 11:15:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>S1: A $6 R1 competitor?</title><link>https://timkellogg.me/blog/2025/02/03/s1</link><author>tkellogg</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 11:05:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new paper released on Friday is making waves in the AI community, not because of the model 
it describes, but because it shows how close we are to some very large breakthroughs in AI. The model
is just below state of the art, but it can run on my laptop. More important, it sheds light on how all
this stuff works, and it’s .OpenAI were the first to claim the inference-time scaling laws. Basically, an LLM can get higher performance
if it can “think” longer before answering. But, like,  How do you make it think longer?OpenAI and R1 had cool graphs showing performance scaling with average thinking time (this from
the s1 paper):But  do they control the length of an LLM response? Everyone skipped over that part, but s1
shows us details, .Context: When an LLM “thinks” at inference time, it puts it’s thoughts inside  and 
 XML tags. Once it gets past the end tag the model is taught to change voice into a confident
and authoritative tone for the final answer.In s1, when the LLM tries to stop thinking with , they force it to keep going
by replacing it with . It’ll then begin to second guess and double check it’s answer. They
do this to trim or extend thinking time (trimming is just abruptly inserting ).So for  versus , that’s likely how they do it. They probably trained 3
models, and with each with a different average thinking time (as measured during training). Eventually the 
training process begins to encode that behavior into the model weights.The trick is so dumb you can do it at inference time too. I’m kicking myself for not understanding
this earlier, because it’s what entropix is all about, and I wrote a lot about entropix.In entropix, they look at the entropy & varentropy of the logits (and attention) to change how the
tokens are selected. In fact, they used tokens like “Wait” to force the LLM to second guess itself.
Although there was more to it, they also tweaked sampler setting to make
it more creative, or to go into aggressive exploration mode, all depending on the internal state
of the model.My hunch is that we’ll  of entropix, or something directly inspired from it. Although, it’s
unclear if it’ll appear predominately in training or inference time.Someone on LinkedIn showed me a piece about token forcing. They convince R1
to share everything it knows about Tiananmen Square by prefixing the bot message with . 
R1 then takes the suggestion and tells what it knows. They suggest that this could be a good 
introspection technique for understanding the models better.(R1 is a Chinese model and has been fine tuned to avoid talking about events like Tiananmen Square)Why did it cost only $6? Because they used a  and hardly any data.After sifting their dataset of 56K examples down to just the best 1K, they found that the core 1K 
is all that’s needed to achieve o1-preview performance on a 32B model. Adding data didn’t raise 
performance .32B is a small model, I can run that on my laptop. They used 16 NVIDIA H100s for 26 minutes per 
training run, that equates to around $6.The low cost means you can do a lot of runs, and they did. As we’ll see, they heavily used a 
technique called ablation, re-running the entire training process with  in 
configuration to prove what works and what doesn’t.For example, how did they figure out it should be “Wait” and not “Hmm”? They also measured properties of the training dataset, which examples provided the most signal:They did a ton of these ablation experiments. This is how you .We like to think that
OpenAI or DeepSeek are simply packed full of brilliant people and they make a wild guess, spend
$10,000,000.00 on a training run and BAM! an innovation is created. But no, even the smartest
people make hundreds of .Innovations like s1 that dramatically lower costs mean that researchers can learn and understand
these models faster. And that directly translates to a  of AI development.Again, AI is inseparable from politics, sorry.There’s debate about OpenAI & Anthropic’s vast funding. It’s tempting to see cost reducing 
innovations like s1 or DeepSeek V3 and assume that OpenAI & Anthropic’s vast datacenters are
a waste of money. I’d argue that no, having 10,000 H100s just means that you can do 625 times
 than s1 did.If you believe that AI development is a prime national security advantage, then you absolutely
should want even more money poured into AI development, to make it go .Note that this s1 dataset is . Every example is a thought trace generated by 
another model, Qwen2.5,
prompted to think before answering. OpenAI has been accusing DeepSeek of creating their
V3 model by distilling from o1, which is against their terms of service. There’s still no strong public
evidence in either direction, so accusations are mostly empty, but s1 gives a lot of credence.Going forward, it’ll be nearly impossible to prevent distealing (unauthorized distilling). One thousand
examples is definitely within the range of what a single person might do in normal usage, no less 
ten or a hundred people. I doubt that OpenAI has a realistic path to  or even 
distealing outside of simply not releasing models.Note that OpenAI released their o3 model as
deep research, an agent instead of direct access to the model API. This might be a trend now,
“agents” serving as a way to avoid releasing direct access to a model.S1 is important because it illustrates the current pace of AI development that’s happening in
the open. When you consider how much compute is available to the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic,
the potential true pace of AI development is .S1 isn’t a replication of R1 or o1. Those were demonstrations in pure reinforcement learning (RL).
S1 shows that supervised fine tuning (SFT) shows just as much potential. That means researchers have
multiple paths to investigate for pushing forward inference-time scaling.I think it’s safe to say that we’re going to see some very big things in ‘25. It’s barely February…]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Caves of Qud with Brian Bucklew</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/02/05/caves-of-qud-with-brian-bucklew/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=caves-of-qud-with-brian-bucklew</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED9626101996.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 10:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Caves of Qud is a roguelike game set in a richly detailed, post-apocalyptic world blending science fiction and fantasy.

Moranda Reilly always wanted to work in aviation. She read books on aviation heroes, watched air disasters, she listened to live air traffic control in her car. Around her neck, she wore an airplane necklace, a gift from a friend that she’d mended repeatedly. In her 20s, she elected to take the plunge and do whatever it took to make it happen. She quit her full-time job, took out student loans, and moved to attend a university that offered a two-year degree as part of the FAA’s collegiate training initiative (CTI) for air traffic controllers. The FAA had established its CTI program in 1989, working together alongside a select group of universities and community colleges to build a better-prepared, college-educated workforce. By the early 2010s, when Moranda and other aspiring air traffic controllers entered the program, CTI was the primary way by which people would enter the field, with the FAA accepting virtually no off-the-street hires. On its website, the FAA instructed aspiring air traffic controllers that if they got CTI degrees, passed the profession’s aptitude test (the AT-SAT), and met other eligibility requirements, it would place them into a priority hiring queue, giving them first opportunity every time employment slots opened up. Students understood that the FAA hired virtually everyone who completed the program and passed the assessment.As the CTI program ramped up with increasing success in the mid-2000s, Florida State College of Jacksonville applied to join, and in 2008, Sam Fischer launched their program. By 2013, he had settled into a comfortable rhythm, training wave after wave of successful students.Andrew Brigida, a 2013 graduate from Arizona State’s CTI program, had just aced the AT-SAT, getting perfect marks while meeting all other job requirements. He was fully qualified, poised to become an air traffic controller.First, every past aptitude test applicants had taken was voided. Andrew Brigida’s perfect score was meaningless.Second, every applicant would be required to take and pass an unspecified “biographical questionnaire” to have a shot at entering the profession.Third, existing CTI students were left with no advantage in the hiring process, which would be equally open to all off-the-street applicants—their degrees rendered useless for the one specialized job they had trained for.The rules had changed, and students and program managers alike were left scrambling to figure out what was going on.Days after the announcement, Reilly launched a Facebook group for CTI students and instructors to grapple with what was happening. “This page doesn’t support the ‘angry mob’ mentality or anything but positive ‘We believe in CTI schools’ vibes,” she wrote. “We believe that all of the simulator hours spent, materials studied, and education taught in C.T.I. schools has value and is of worth.”More than a hundred people joined in the first day. Brigida and Fischer jumped on quickly, helping Reilly to organize the group and walking the anxious crowd through everything they were learning. Fischer provided status updates, Reilly jumped in with rallying cries and organization (“Save CTI! Save CTI! Save CTI!”), and Brigida gave the group a public face. The next hiring wave would be in February 2014, and the CTI graduates and students waited anxiously, grasping at every bit of information they could find to understand what was going on. As the hiring wave approached, some of Reilly’s friends in the program encouraged her to join the National Black Coalition of Federal Aviation Employees (NBCFAE), telling her it would help improve her chances of being hired. She signed up as the February wave started. Soon, though, she became uneasy with what the organization was doing, particularly after she and the rest of the group got a voice message from FAA employee Shelton Snow:hereReilly, Brigida, and thousands of others found themselves faced with the questionnaire, clicking through a bizarre sequence of questions that would determine whether they could enter the profession they’d been working towards. Faced with the opportunity to cheat, Reilly did not. It cost her a shot at becoming an air traffic controller. Like 85% of their fellow CTI students, Brigida and Reilly found themselves faced with a red exclamation point and a dismissal notice: “Based upon your responses to the Biographical Assessment, we have determined that you are NOT eligible for this position.”Their plans had been upended. No chance for appeal. No way around it short of waiting another year and trying again. Despite their qualifications and their passion, they would not be air traffic controllers.“You Have Been Intentionally Discriminated Against.”So what happened? Why did the FAA upend a stable hiring process, undercut the CTI schools it had established to train its workforce, and throw the plans of thousands of eager would-be air traffic controllers into disarray? I give a bare-bones accounting of the background in another article, but there are a few more details worth adding in this one.The CTI program was popular and successful before the barrier analysis. After 2013, though, the FAA began to treat its CTI schools as a liability. After the biographical questionnaire, per conversations with CTI administrators, the FAA simply tried to pretend the CTI schools did not exist. The FAA cut off communication, treating them tersely and with disdain. The schools were not bastions of privilege. The programs were often at community colleges and junior colleges, with diverse student bodies and professors who worked long hours helping them. They were successful and effective at what they did, and had provided a steady stream of applicants who saw a clear path into the profession. Suddenly, though, they were left scrambling to justify their existence. Fischer talks about how he used to get lots of calls from students asking how to become an air traffic controller, but after 2013, that mostly stopped. He emphasizes that the FAA was never there to give him a job, and if they wanted to change, that was their prerogative. A lot of the problem, and a lot of the sore feelings between the FAA and the CTI schools, came because of the abruptness of the change, the lack of communication, the sudden cutting off.Fischer, alongside other program directors like Joe Eichelberger, began to organize the CTI schools and take meticulous notes. What were success rates like before the scandal? What about after? What had happened, and why? How could they continue to justify their programs to students who could no longer trust that there would be jobs waiting at the other end? gave a few remarksIt’s an incredible safety concern… what we’re dealing with here is a shortage of air traffic controllers. We had a process by which to provide candidates, who were very well-qualified, who were spending a lot of money on their own… and the FAA has apparently decided to arbitrarily abandon that process. And now when you add onto it the cheating scandal, which clearly is a huge problem, and an FAA official who is trying to pretend it’s not part of what they have to worry about… that’s ludicrous.a lettermore specificallyAll of this is included in the investigation report.Why do we have access to the questionnaire, the investigation report, and other critical documents necessary to pull together this story? Ask Jorge Rojas. Jorge Rojas always wanted to be an air traffic controller. He went to CTI school right after high school and saw all of the 2014 chaos from a distance. In 2015, when he became eligible to take the questionnaire, he did so. Failed. Took it again in 2016. Failed. It was only after Congress explicitly passed a law rejecting the FAA’s use of the biographical questionnaire that he had an opportunity to enter the role. He worked for the FAA for five years before returning to become a government contractor. But he was frustrated—frustrated on his behalf, frustrated on the behalf of others who had had their lives thrown into turmoil. So he began filing FOIA requests.Rojas filed hundreds of requests over the course of multiple years. The FAA delayed some, rejected others, and per Rojas, took the stance that “he’s not going to sue us for all of them.” Sometimes, he even went back to FOIA his FOIAs, to see what was taking so long and how they were responding. Five separate times, he took the FAA to court over refusals and delays.After long delays and repeated sanctions, the FAA finally produced some of the key documents. He got the questionnaire, the answer key. He got the investigation into Shelton Snow. As of last year when I spoke with him, the FAA was still gradually, periodically, releasing documents to him, responding to FOIAs from back in 2016. Along the whole way, Michael Pearson, soon aided by attorneys from the Mountain States Legal Foundation, worked diligently on the case. Mountain States Legal Foundation is a small non-profit firm; the case is an ambitious one. They have spent years gathering evidence, arguing in court, pushing for class certification, and preparing to bring the case to trial. The case is scheduled to go to trial next year. a memorandumCaleb Benner, who graduated in 2012 from Purdue University’s Aviation Management program, one of the FAA’s designated CTI programs, spent his entire childhood dreaming of becoming an air traffic controller. When other kids responded “firefighter” or “police officer” when asked “What do you want to do when you grow up?”, he always said “air traffic controller.” He took the AT-SAT after graduation and got a score in the high 90s, only for hiring to be hit by sequestration before he could apply. When they came out of sequestration and he was preparing to apply properly, he learned about the Biographical Assessment after the New Year’s Eve announcement. He took it. He failed.After failing the assessment, he spent multiple years working a job paying $10 an hour, one he specifically chose so it would be easy to uproot and go to the Academy to train when he got the call. The call never came. Eventually, he gave up, paid to get his aircraft dispatcher’s license, and moved on. Benner hates that this accident brought the scandal to the forefront after a decade in the courts, and is not fond of how Trump has handled it. But, as he puts it, “That doesn’t change how blatantly wrong it was what the FAA did. And I spent what seems like every day of my career dealing with the consequences of those decisions.”Others tell similar stories. Another CTI grad tells me he became a police dispatcher (“to sate my need to talk into a headset for 8 hours a day”) and worked on getting a private rotorcraft license afterward—explained that he didn’t feel bitter, exactly, but he felt wronged. Robbed. Reilly has remained a passionate advocate for the issue over the years. She reached out to me almost immediately after I published my original article, providing an extensive look at the years of conversations, advocacy, and work the scandal has taken. She has moved on to work in air traffic management. She remains a passionate advocate for women in aviation and spends time volunteering on youth outreach programs. Last year, she organized an event at the Reagan airport in DC, busing in 150 girls from a Title 1 school. Many, she said, had never seen an airplane up close before. In a moment of dark irony, the sort of diversity-focused work she’s passionate about—not lowering the bar, but inspiring more people and providing them with mentorship and opportunity to reach it—is threatened by Trump’s memorandum. Has this had a long-term impact on aviation safety and air traffic controller shortages? Likely yes. An active air traffic controller reached out to me at the end of January last year, talking about his frustration that so many qualified individuals were eliminated from entering training, contributing to a dire staffing shortage. His facility was operating at less than 75%, with controllers fatigued from working 6-day weeks. As he explained it, training can take 1.5 to 2.5 years at larger facilities, with washout rates from 30-60%, and when we spoke upper level facilities were only accepting transfers from lower level facilities, adding years to preparation time. Every issue compounds and adds to the problem over time, and the FAA’s 2013 changes set staffing back years. The FAA, he said, simply is not bringing in enough people to match the number leaving, with some air traffic controllers believing the agency is failing on purpose to find an excuse to privatize them. A controller who worked for 25 years and retired in 2015 spoke with me last January as well. He had been offered a position at Oklahoma City to instruct new students. Per him, the ideal candidate can go from street to fully certified in about 4 years, while some trainees during his last few years had been training for 6-8 years. He alleged a pattern where some students were trained for years longer than others, rarely washed out, and were quietly checked out and promoted away from direct air traffic control positions into management.Another retired controller and supervisor who formerly worked at the Chicago ARTCC echoed his story, claiming the FAA would regularly change the “best qualified list,” with those responsible for promotions changing requirements depending on who they wanted to promote. He was never told to certify an inadequate trainee, he said, but “the pressure was mounting.”Applicant quality matters in several ways. Weaker applicants are more likely to drop out in training, to take longer going through the pipeline and in on-the-job training (where experienced controllers have to work directly with them, taking other bodies off the job), and to wind up working in less busy airfields. This matters particularly because there are fixed numbers each year and the pipeline takes several years to get through, so real problems take a few years to filter through the pipeline and be felt. The 2014 change materially shifted applicant quality on net. While it is technically and tautologically true that everyone who makes it through training is qualified, the “qualified” bar on the AT-SAT eliminated very few candidates, with quality maintained mostly by the “well qualified” bar. Higher scores were genuinely predictive of better performance, and 2014 shifted applicant population. Not only that, it shattered the pipeline the FAA had built with CTI schools, making the process towards becoming an air traffic controller less certain, undercutting many of the most passionate people working to train prospective controllers, and leading to a tense and unclear relationship between the FAA and feeder organizations. Did anyone truly unqualified make it all the way through the pipeline? There's no reason to think so. Did average candidate quality decrease? There's every reason to think so. Would that lead to staffing issues? Unambiguously yes.New York TimesAs I write this story, we are in a moment of intense partisan divide, with everyone mad and very few terribly inclined to give grace or look for nuance. In part because of that, I don’t think this story can be treated as complete without making the undercurrent of its interaction with political partisanship clear and speaking directly to those sympathetic to one side or the other.I dislike Trump as much as anyone. Maybe I’m not supposed to play my hand like that while reporting a news article, but it’s true. I’ve wanted him out of politics since he entered the scene a decade ago, I voted against him three elections in a row, and I think he’s had a uniquely destructive effect within US politics. So I understand—please believe, I understand—just how disquieting it is to watch him stand up and blame DEI after a major tragedy. a thoroughly reported article on air traffic controller shortagesThe class members have mixed sentiments as things stand. Some are thrilled that what they see as the scourge of destructive DEI initiatives is finally being addressed. Others are liberals who are frustrated and hurt that something they worked so hard to keep nonpartisan, a real scandal that hurt them, can now be little but a partisan wedge, and they’re not happy with the way Trump is handling it.Trump isn’t handling the scandal how I would, but when is that not true? I expect collateral damage, I expect intense partisanship and noise, I expect chaos. But at the core, fundamentally, I can’t be unhappy that after a decade, a President finally brought attention to the scandal. I realize political expediency makes talking about the scandal a losing battle for Democrats now that the Biden admin declined to fix it, but a lot of the class members were badly hoping it could be resolved in a nuanced bipartisan way. It's a partisan cudgel right now because the FAA elected to sweep it under the rug for three administrations in a row rather than frankly and honestly cutting out the rot.Fundamentally, people should not be forced to choose between “burn it all down” and “sweep it under the rug.” People should not be forced to choose between lowering the bar and rejecting all outreach to struggling communities. Given the recent election, Democrats have years to build a vision of diversity that involves providing more opportunities for everyone to reach a high bar, not lowering the bar—one that involves making institutions work, not obfuscating institutional failure until it can no longer be hidden. The time is right for this, and not only can it happen, it should happen. The right way to draw a contrast with Trump is not denying that there was ever an issue, but showing that people who fundamentally believe in the value of institutions and in extending opportunity to a diverse citizenship understand the issues and are prepared to solve them better than bomb-throwers ever could. Finally, to conservatives: Drink my lib tearsSteve SailerAll of that is true. But please, as you’re handling this—as you’re digging up the corruption, understanding the failure, rooting through the mess—remember that without principled, brave, honest people like Moranda Reilly, all of this might have stayed hidden forever. It all could have died in obscurity. Remember that at root, this really is a bipartisan issue, and many of the class members really do believe in the value of diversity programs that provide a wider range of people opportunity to meet a high bar. I know Democrats had a chance to clean it up, and they didn’t, and now you’re going to do things your way. I get that. But please remember the people at the root, and remember that it took a whole lot more than just conservatives to fight this. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[UPDATE] A Dangerous Assignment: Uncovering Corruption in Maduro’s Venezuela (full documentary)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWnZF6zpbPY</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MWnZF6zpbPY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 03:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch an updated version of FRONTLINE and Armando.info’s 2024 documentary on a corruption scandal spanning from Venezuela to the U.S., and what has happened to the journalists who helped uncover the story.

In 1642, England was torn apart by a fierce struggle. Royalist armies, loyal to the defiant King Charles I, clashed with the forces of Parliament, igniting a violent civil war that would decide the fate of the monarchy and the nation. In this second episode, we hear about some of the bloodiest battles between Roundheads and Cavaliers, the leaders who came to the fore during these trying years and how the two sides eventually arrived at a shaky truce.For this, Dan is joined by Minoo Dinshaw, author of 'Friends in Youth: Choosing Sides in the English Civil War'. He explains this tumultuous period from the perspective of Bulstrode Whitelocke and Edward Hyde, two close friends who reluctantly found themselves on opposing sides of the conflict that split England in two.Produced by James Hickmann and edited by Max Carrey.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Beej&apos;s Guide to Git</title><link>https://beej.us/guide/bggit/</link><author>mixto</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 00:07:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Please keep in mind that I'm only human and there is a

Schaller discusses how the Red Hat team plans to integrate AI with IBM's open-source Granite engine to enhance developer tools, such as IDEs, and create an AI-powered Code Assistant. He says the team is also working on streamlining AI acceleration in Toolbx and ensuring Fedora users have access to tools like RamaLama. From the post: One big item on our list for the year is looking at ways Fedora Workstation can make use of artificial intelligence. Thanks to IBMs Granite effort we know have an AI engine that is available under proper open source licensing terms and which can be extended for many different usecases. Also the IBM Granite team has an aggressive plan for releasing updated versions of Granite, incorporating new features of special interest to developers, like making Granite a great engine to power IDEs and similar tools. We been brainstorming various ideas in the team for how we can make use of AI to provide improved or new features to users of GNOME and Fedora Workstation. This includes making sure Fedora Workstation users have access to great tools like RamaLama, that we make sure setting up accelerated AI inside Toolbx is simple, that we offer a good Code Assistant based on Granite and that we come up with other cool integration points. "I'm still not sure how I feel about this approach," writes designer/developer and blogger, Bradley Taunt. "While IBM Granite is an open source model, I still don't enjoy so much artificial 'intelligence' creeping into core OS development. This also isn't something optional on the end-users side, like a desktop feature or package. This sounds like it's going to be built directly into the core system."
 
"Red Hat has been pushing hard towards AI and my main concern is having this influence other operating system dev teams. Luckily things seems AI-free in BSD land. For now, at least."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Expert Engineers Meta’s Video Recommendations</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-expert-meta-video-recommendations</link><author>Willie D.

I spent my weekly allowance to play VF and VF2 in arcades, cavorted cross-country in search of rare Virtua Fighter 3 cabinets, and eventually connected with overseas friends by playing VF4 Evolution and Final Tuned in Japan. So when I see a new--or new-ish, in this case--Virtua Fighter game get released, I want it to be the best it can possibly be. Not just for myself, but so others can pick it up and understand why we longtime Virtua Fighter players adore these games so much.Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown--released a few years back on PS4--was a solid attempt at this, bringing the much-loved VF5 Final Showdown to PS4 with a fresh coat of paint. However, it fumbled in some key areas--particularly the netcode, which was a bizarre delay-based system in an era when fighting game developers were quickly and vocally embracing superior rollback systems. Now, with a new Virtua Fighter in active development and people talking about the series again, Sega has given us Virtua Fighter 5 REVO: another revision exclusively for PCs with the much-longed-for and player-demanded rollback netcode.The rollback netcode is clearly the major selling point here, as much of the game is still built upon the foundation of VF5 Ultimate Showdown: The menu graphics, interface, and character models are largely the same, with a bit of extra polish and visual flair if you've got solid graphics hardware. But that's fine--those areas didn't need much improvement, so why fix what isn't broken?Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Play with real quantum physics in your browser</title><link>https://quantum.orgsoft.org/</link><author>mattvr</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 18:24:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Accidental Socialists</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZnxHjhtODw</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aZnxHjhtODw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 18:07:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Discussing the Frontier of Particle Physics with Brian Cox</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urFIHf5coxE</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/urFIHf5coxE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 18:00:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Go to https://ground.news/startalk to stay fully informed on the latest Space and Science news.

How much more physics is out there to be discovered? Neil deGrasse Tyson sits down with physicist, professor, and rockstar Brian Cox, to discuss everything from the Higgs boson, life beyond our planet, and the fundamental forces that guide our universe.

We dive into the cutting-edge world of particle physics. Brian explains the incredible discoveries made at CERN, including the Higgs boson, and why smashing protons together at nearly the speed of light unlocks the building blocks of the universe. What mysteries remain in the standard model of physics? Brian unpacks the search for supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and dark matter while highlighting the challenges of exploring particles that only exist fleetingly after high-energy collisions.

The conversation then shifts to the grand cosmic scale. Brian and Neil explore the relationship between particle physics and astrophysics. Could gravity be a particle? What do these nearly massless particles tell us about the universe’s deeper truths? And how might the future of experiments like the Large Hadron Collider reshape our understanding of reality?

To wrap up, Brian shares his passion for public science communication and the philosophical questions that drive his work. Learn about his global live tour, Horizons, which combines stunning visuals, classical music, and a celebration of the universe’s vastness. Discover the excitement behind upcoming missions like the Europa Clipper and how moons like Europa and Io may hold the keys to extraterrestrial life.

With a mix of rock and roll energy, groundbreaking physics, and profound philosophical questions, this episode takes you on a journey through the smallest particles to the largest structures in the cosmos—and everything in between.

AI & Aliens: New Eyes on Ancient Questions // MLOps Podcast #288 with Richard Cloete, 
Laukien-Oumuamua Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard University.

// Abstract
Demetrios speaks with Dr. Richard Cloete, a Harvard computer scientist and founder of SEAQR Robotics, about his AI-driven work in tracking Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) through the Galileo Project. Dr. Cloete explains their advanced sensor setup and the challenges of training AI in this niche field, leading to the creation of AeroSynth, a synthetic data tool.

He also discusses his collaboration with the Minor Planet Center on using AI to classify interstellar objects and upcoming telescope data. Additionally, he introduces Seeker Robotics, applying similar AI techniques to oceanic research with unmanned vehicles for marine monitoring. The conversation explores AI’s role in advancing our understanding of space and the ocean.

// Bio
Richard is a computer scientist and Laukien-Oumuamua Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard University. As a member of the Galileo Project under Professor Avi Loeb's supervision, he develops AI models for detecting and tracking aerial objects, specializing in Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). 

Beyond UAP research, he collaborates with astronomers at the Minor Planet Center to create AI models for identifying potential interstellar objects using the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory. 

Richard is also the CEO and co-founder of SEAQR Robotics, a startup developing advanced unmanned surface vehicles to accelerate the discovery of novel life and phenomena in Earth's oceans and atmosphere. 

Before joining Harvard, he completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Cambridge, UK, where his research explored the intersection of emerging technologies and law.Grew up in Cape Town, South Africa, where I used to build Tesla Coils, plasma globes, radio stethoscopes, microwave guns, AM radios, and bombs...

After living in the United States for six decades, he returned to Germany in 2012. Ever since then, he’s been working to educate people.

Unlike many adults, younger people aren’t as reserved when meeting the Holocaust survivor. They ask him all sorts of questions and take selfies with him - including the concentration camp tattoo on his arm.

Weinberg was born in the East Frisia region of northern Germany in 1925. Adolf Hitler taking power in 1933 changed the trajectory of his family life forever. Like other Jewish families, the Weinberg’s were victims of persecution, exploitation, and murder. Albrecht's parents, Alfred and Flora, were killed in Auschwitz. Albrecht himself survived and emigrated to the United States.

He finally returned to Germany 13 years ago. Since then he’s been trying to reconcile himself with the country of his birth. At his side is his former nurse, Gerda Dänekas - the two are now roommates and best friends. For years, Albrecht and Gerda have been working to raise awareness about the Holocaust and ensure its remembrance. They visit schools and memorial sites, give speeches, and talk to the media. Recent developments, such as antisemitic incidents in Germany and the rise of right-wing extremists, have motivated the pair to maintain their fight against hatred and antisemitism for as long as possible.

This film shows the two friends going about their work, as well as their everyday life together. Even though 99-year-old Albrecht Weinberg no longer has the energy he used to, Gerda is committed to sharing his story, as well as that of other Holocaust victims.

That’s good—computers need precision. But it also forces humans to think like machines.For decades we tried to fix this by making programming more human-friendly. Higher-level languages. Visual interfaces. Each step helped, but we were still translating human thoughts into computer instructions.AI was supposed to change everything. Finally, plain English could be a programming language—one everyone already knows. No syntax. No rules. Just say what you want.The first wave of AI coding tools squandered this opportunity. They make flashy demos but produce garbage software. People call them “great for prototyping,” which means “don’t use this for anything real.”Many blame the AI models, saying we just need them to get smarter. This is wrong. Yes, better AI will make better guesses about what you mean. But when you’re building serious software, you don’t want guesses—even smart ones. You want to know exactly what you’re building.Current AI tools pretend writing software is like having a conversation. It’s not. It’s like writing laws. You’re using English, but you’re defining terms, establishing rules, and managing complex interactions between everything you’ve said.Try writing a tax code in chat messages. You can’t. Even simple tax codes are too complex to keep in your head. That’s why we use documents—they let us organize complexity, reference specific points, and track changes systematically. Chat reduces you to memory and hope.This is the core problem. You can’t build real software without being precise about what you want. Every successful programming tool in history reflects this truth. AI briefly fooled us into thinking we could just chat our way to working software.We can’t. You don’t program by chatting. You program by writing documents.When your intent is in a document instead of scattered across a chat log, English becomes a real programming language:You can see your whole system at onceYou can clarify and improve your intentYou can track changes properlyTeams can work on the system togetherRequirements become their own quality checksChanges start from clear specificationsThe first company to get this will own the next phase of AI development tools. They’ll build tools for real software instead of toys. They’ll make everything available today look like primitive experiments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why you feel stuck — and how to get motivated - Shannon Odell</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD3-DKkiVeA</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kD3-DKkiVeA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 16:01:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dig into the psychology of how to overcome your motivational obstacles and regain focus when you feel stuck in achieving your goals.

--

Many of us have experienced feeling stuck. People often report feeling highly motivated at the start and end of a project, but the middle can feel untethered. It can happen when tackling something as simple as a term paper or as monumental as social inequality or the climate crisis. So, are there ways to get unstuck? Shannon Odell digs into the psychology of overcoming your motivational obstacles.

From managing dynamic permissions to implementing fine-grained access controls, the challenges grow as your requirements and users scale.This eBook will guide you through the 6 key requirements all authorization layers should include to avoid technical debt:Architectural and design considerations for building a scalable and secure authorization layer.20+ technologies, approaches, and standards to consider for your permission management systems.Practical insights, based on 500+ interviews with engineers, architects, and IAM professionals.Learn how to create an authorization solution that evolves with your business needs, while avoiding technical debt.How to Scale MicroservicesThey wanted to reduce the maintenance effort and scale microservices quickly.So they relied on automation.A microservice must be scaled to handle changing traffic.Yet scaling manually is slow and causes errors.So they use infrastructure as code to keep things simple; it’s used to deploy new instances based on demand.  means managing and provisioning infrastructure using code.Ready for the next technique?It’s difficult to understand and maintain APIs without a proper naming convention.Yet maintaining consistent naming for APIs across microservices is hard. So they generate APIs using code and store API definitions as JSON in a separate Git repository.Here are the benefits of code-generated APIs:API paths can be validated using linters.API naming conventions and request-response structures are standardized.API version changes can be tracked through tagging.It ensures API operations are defined.User-friendly API paths can be set up as default.Also it standardizes APIs built using different programming languages. Put simply, code generation makes it look like a single person wrote APIs across the system.Besides code generation ensures health checks are included in each microservice.A health check URL is included in the API specification of the microservice.An unhealthy service is removed from production to avoid service interruptions.A change to database schema shouldn’t break microservices depending on it. Yet sharing a single database across microservices introduces tight coupling and failure risk.So they set up separate databases for each microservice.But maintaining many databases is a huge effort; so, they create databases and tables using code.Here are its main benefits:Consistent database names.Ensure proper database indexes exist from the start.Easy to maintain and operate the database.Besides a microservice shouldn't talk to a database owned by another microservice. Instead, communication happens only via the microservice’s API owning the database. Otherwise, the data changes aren't safe as they bypass business logic.: use code generation and automation to scale microservices quickly. It reduces maintenance efforts and helps with version control.👋  -Do you want to level up at work and better understand technical discussions?My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than 37 minutes a month.I launched the newsletter deep dives last month.Yet future deep dives, starting this month, are available only to paid subscribers.And subscription fees will be higher than the current fees.So pledge now to get access at a very low price.“This newsletter is an amazing resource for learning system design.” AlexSubscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.You are now 123,001+ readers strong, very close to 124k.

1. This megacity was built on top of a former lake. The soil has become more and more compacted over time.  

2. The city’s main water supply is underground – and it’s being overused. 

3. Mexico City’s located in one of the world’s most active earthquakes zones. As the water supply dries up, the ground becomes less stable. 

More than 22 million people live in Mexico City, and the aging water infrastructure just can’t keep up. To compensate, water is brought in from other states. That may offer some relief to the city, but it ultimately ends up leaving those other areas dry.

ABSTRACT
Why is it so easy to screw up platform engineering, and how do you undo the damage?

Platform engineering… it’s the trendy new buzzword. For a thing we’ve been doing for years, ever since someone said “what if we re-did Solaris zones, but called it Docker instead?” It means building an internal engineering platform for your digital services or data pipelines. It allows you to scale teams up and down, and supercharge their abilities to deliver outcomes.

But here’s a thing that nobody likes to talk about. It’s easy to totally screw up platform engineering. When that happens, there’s a huge negative impact on your engineering culture, and your teams aren’t able to achieve their goals. So how do you avoid screwing up platform engineering, and if it does happen to you, can you actually fix it?

I’ve spent years in platform leadership roles, building internal engineering platforms at different scaleups and enterprise organizations. I’ve had successes, and I’ve had failures. I’ll cover the following irreversible ways to screw up, and how to start reversing out of them:

• Power tools - teams spend all their time configuring Kafka, Kubernetes, Istio etc., because the platform is based on overpowered tech
• Technology anarchy - N teams do the same task in N different ways, because the platform has no opinions on tech choices, ways of working, or path to prod
• Teams as tickets - making teams interact with the platform via tickets

And I’ll explain why all of these can be traced back to a scaling problem, the granddaddy screw up of platform engineering - your mindset is platform as a project, not as a product.

Takeaways
• Platform engineering is about creating an enabler of business value, so your teams can move faster and safer than ever before
• Avoid using platform engineering power tools e.g. Kafka, Kubernetes, Istio. If you’re using them, start measuring unplanned work and plan to migrate away
• Avoid being unopinionated on tech stack, ways of working, and path to prod. If you’re doing that, capture your leadership team’s expectations and track team commitments
• Avoid only interacting with teams through a ticketing system. If you’re stuck there, start collaborating with teams on self-service paved roads
• The key to platform engineering success is a platform as a product mindset [...]

Both services have largely depended on free server resources provided by Equinix (formerly Packet.net) and its Metal division for the past few years. Equinix announced recently that it was sunsetting its bare-metal sales and services, or renting out physically distinct single computers rather than virtualized and shared hardware. As reported by the Phoronix blog, both free software organizations have until the end of April to find and fund new hosting, with some fairly demanding bandwidth and development needs.
 
An issue ticket on Freedesktop.org's GitLab repository provides the story and the nitty-gritty needs of that project. Both the X.org foundation (home of the 40-year-old window system) and Freedesktop.org (a shared base of specifications and technology for free software desktops, including Wayland and many more) used Equinix's donated space. [...] Alpine Linux, a small, security-minded distribution used in many containers and embedded devices, also needs a new home quickly. As detailed in its blog, Alpine Linux uses about 800TB of bandwidth each month and also needs continuous integration runners (or separate job agents), as well as a development box. Alpine states it is seeking co-location space and bare-metal servers near the Netherlands, though it will consider virtual machines if bare metal is not feasible.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Maximizing Cloud Efficiency with Jerzy Grzywinski and Brent Segner</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/02/04/maximizing-cloud-efficiency-with-jerzy-grzywinski-and-brent-segner/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=maximizing-cloud-efficiency-with-jerzy-grzywinski-and-brent-segner</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED1045788818.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 10:00:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Compute optimization in a cloud environment is a common challenge because of the need to balance performance, cost, and resource availability.

A customer places an order, and your system needs to deduct the item from inventory, charge the customer’s credit card, and record the sale in your accounting system—all at once. What happens if the payment fails but your inventory count has already been reduced? Or if your application crashes halfway through the process?This is where  come into play. They ensure that all the steps in such critical operations happen reliably and consistently.ACID is an acronym that refers to the set of 4 key properties that define a transaction: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and In this article, we’ll dive into what each of the ACID properties mean, why they are important, and how they are implemented in databases.A  in the context of databases is a sequence of one or more operations (such as inserting, updating, or deleting records) that the database treats as . It either fully succeeds or fully fails, with no in-between states.When you send money to a friend, two things happen:Money is deducted from your account.Money is added to their account.These two steps form . If either step fails, both are canceled.Without transactions, databases could end up in inconsistent states. : Your money is deducted, but your friend never receives it.: Two people booking the last movie ticket at the same time.Transactions solve these problems by enforcing rules like  (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).Now, lets looks at each of the ACID properties.Atomicity ensures that a transaction—comprising multiple operations—executes as a unit of work: it either  succeeds (commits) or  fails (rolls back). If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is restored to a state exactly as it was before the transaction began.In a money transfer transaction, if the credit step fails, the debit step cannot be allowed to stand on its own. This prevents inconsistent states like “money disappearing” from one account without showing up in another.Atomicity abstracts away the complexity of manually undoing changes if something goes wrong.How Databases Implement AtomicityDatabases use two key mechanisms to guarantee atomicity.1. Transaction Logs (Write-Ahead Logs)Every operation is recorded in a  before it’s applied to the actual database table.If a failure occurs, the database uses this log to  incomplete changes.Once the WAL entry is safely on disk, the database proceeds with modifying the in-memory pages that contain rows for  and .When the operations succeed:The database marks  as  in the transaction log.The newly updated balances for A and B will eventually get flushed from memory to their respective data files on disk.If the database crashes  the log entry is written but  the data files are fully updated, the WAL provides a way to recover:On restart, the database checks the WAL.It sees  was committed.It reapplies the  operations to ensure the final balances are correct in the data files.If the transaction had not committed (or was marked as “in progress”) at the time of the crash, the database would  those changes using information in the log, leaving the table as if the transaction never happened.2. Commit/Rollback ProtocolsDatabases provide commands like , , and Any changes made between  and  are considered “in-progress” and won’t be permanently applied unless the transaction commits successfully.If any step fails, or if you explicitly issue a , all changes since the start of the transaction are undone. in the context of ACID transactions ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another valid state—never leaving it in a broken or “invalid” state.It means that all the data integrity constraints, such as  (no duplicate IDs),  (related records must exist in parent tables), and (age can’t be negative), are satisfied before and after the transaction.If a transaction tries to violate these rules, it will not be committed, and the database will revert to its previous state.You have two tables in an e-commerce database: (with columns: , , etc.) (with columns: , , , etc.): You can’t place an order for a product if  is greater than the  in the  table.If the product’s  was 8 (less than what we’re trying to order), the database sees that the new value would be  which breaks the consistency rule (it should not go negative).The transaction fails or triggers a rollback, preventing the database from ending in an invalid state.How to Implement ConsistencyDatabase Schema Constraints, , , ,  constraints, and other schema definitions ensure no invalid entries are allowed.Triggers and Stored ProceduresTriggers can automatically check additional rules whenever rows are inserted, updated, or deleted.Stored procedures can contain logic to validate data before committing.Application-Level SafeguardsWhile the database enforces constraints at a lower level, applications often add extra checks—like ensuring business rules are followed or data is validated before it even reaches the database layer. ensures that concurrently running transactions do not interfere with each other’s intermediate states.Essentially, while a transaction is in progress, its updates (or intermediate data) remain invisible to other ongoing transactions—giving the illusion that each transaction is running sequentially, one at a time.Without isolation, two or more transactions could read and write partial or uncommitted data from each other, causing incorrect or inconsistent results.With isolation, developers can reason more reliably about how data changes will appear to other transactions.To understand how isolation works, it helps to see what can go wrong without proper isolation.  Common concurrency anomalies include:Transaction A reads data that Transaction B has modified but not yet committed.If Transaction B then rolls back, Transaction A ends up holding an invalid or “dirty” value that never truly existed in the committed state.Transaction A reads the same row(s) multiple times during its execution but sees different data because another transaction updated or deleted those rows in between A’s reads.Transaction A performs a query that returns a set of rows. Another transaction inserts, updates, or deletes rows that match A’s query conditions.If A re-runs the same query, it sees a different set of rows (“phantoms”).Databases typically allow you to choose an , which balances data correctness with performance.Higher isolation levels provide stronger data consistency but can reduce system performance by increasing the wait times for transactions. Let's explore the four common isolation levels:Allows dirty reads; transactions can see uncommitted changes.Rarely used, as it can lead to severe anomalies.A transaction sees only data that has been committed at the moment of reading.Prevents dirty reads, but non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can still occur.Ensures if you read the same rows multiple times within a transaction, you’ll get the same values (unless you explicitly modify them).Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads, but phantom reads may still happen (depending on the database engine).The highest level of isolation, acting as if all transactions happen sequentially one at a time.Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.Most expensive in terms of performance and concurrency because it can require more locking or more conflict checks.How Databases Enforce IsolationPessimistic Concurrency ControlRows or tables are locked so that no other transaction can read or write them until the lock is released.Can lead to blocking or deadlocks if multiple transactions compete for the same locks.2. MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)Optimistic Concurrency ControlInstead of blocking reads, the database keeps multiple versions of a row.Readers see a consistent snapshot of data (like a point-in-time view), while writers create a new version of the row when updating.This approach reduces lock contention but requires carefully managing row versions and cleanup (vacuuming in PostgreSQL, for example).A form of MVCC where each transaction sees data as it was at the start (or a consistent point) of the transaction.Prevents non-repeatable reads and dirty reads. Phantom reads may still occur unless the isolation level is fully serializable. ensures that once a transaction has been committed, the changes it made will survive, even in the face of power failures, crashes, or other catastrophic events. In other words, once a transaction says “done,” the data is permanently recorded and cannot simply disappear.How Databases Ensure Durability1. Transaction Logs (Write-Ahead Logging)Most relational databases rely on a  to preserve changes before they’re written to the main data files:: The intended operations (updates, inserts, deletes) are recorded in the WAL on durable storage (disk).: Once the WAL entry is safely persisted, the database can mark the transaction as committed.Apply Changes to Main Data Files: The updated data eventually gets written to the main files—possibly first in memory, then flushed to disk.If the database crashes, it uses the WAL during :: Any committed transactions not yet reflected in the main files are reapplied.: Any incomplete (uncommitted) transactions are rolled back to keep the database consistent.2. Replication / RedundancyIn addition to WAL, many systems use replication to ensure data remains durable even if hardware or an entire data center fails.: Writes are immediately copied to multiple nodes or data centers. A transaction is marked committed only if the primary and at least one replica confirm it’s safely stored.: Changes eventually sync to other nodes, but there is a (small) window where data loss can occur if the primary fails before the replica is updated.Regular  provide a safety net beyond logs and replication. In case of severe corruption, human error, or catastrophic failure:: Capture the entire database at a point in time.Incremental/Differential Backups: Store changes since the last backup for faster, more frequent backups.: Ensures backups remain safe from localized disasters, allowing you to restore data even if hardware is damaged.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

Congress, dominated by the ruling party, approved last Wednesday a confusing reform to the Bitcoin Law at the request of Bukele’s government, which had no other option to receive the $1.4 billion credit agreed in December with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The reform eliminated the word “currency” when referring to bitcoin, but says it is “legal tender.” Despite the lack of clarity, it lifts, as required by the IMF, the obligation to accept it in transactions or debt payments, a key condition for it to be “legal tender,” according to economic analysts. With the change, “if someone owes you money and wants to pay you in bitcoin, you can refuse to be paid in bitcoin, but you cannot refuse if it’s legal tender,” economist Carlos Acevedo explained.The use of bitcoin in El Salvador’s dollarized economy, according to the new rule, will be optional and will be at the discretion of the private sector to accept cryptocurrency payments for goods and services. Businesses are no longer required to convert dollar prices into this cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin no longer has that force of legal tender. That’s how it should have always remained, but the government wanted to force it and it didn’t work,” economist Rafael Lemus said.The Bitcoin Law reform will take effect 90 days after it’s published in the Official Gazette, which could happen in the coming days. For Acevedo, former president of the former Central Bank, “it makes no sense” to have left in the reformed law that it is “legal tender.” “It’s a monstrosity that’s not understood and that should be corrected and made clear that bitcoin is no longer legal tender,” the economist argues.But even being so, Salvadorans, with the exception of a few, never embraced Bukele’s initiative, who enjoys enormous popularity for his war against gangs, which dropped homicides to historic lows in El Salvador. A recent survey by the Central American University (UCA) revealed that 92% of Salvadorans did not use bitcoin in their transactions in 2024.“I used it and didn’t like it… Very complicated and risky. This is not for an employee who barely gets by on their salary,” Juana Henríquez, a 55-year-old nurse, said, saying she had tried to make some profit and instead lost money. Bukele also failed to achieve his project, which he announced with fireworks, to create Bitcoin City, a high-tech city that would be the capital of bitcoiners in the country and would take energy for mining from a volcano in Conchagua, about 200 km from Salvador.Berlin, a city 110 km east of San Salvador, and El Zonte beach (southwest) are two areas that concentrate bitcoiners, but many are foreign residents or tourists.Bitcoin’s biggest promoter in the country, Bukele, has not yet referred to the legal reform. But officials ensure that the government will continue betting on this cryptocurrency, whose price currently exceeds $100,000. El Salvador’s ambassador to the United States, Milena Mayorga, told journalists Thursday, during a bitcoin event in San Salvador, that the law reforms should be seen as an adaptation “to the circumstances.”The government, she assured, will continue buying bitcoin and having reserves in this cryptocurrency. According to the National Bitcoin Office, El Salvador has 6,050 bitcoins worth $634.8 million. “President Bukele continues buying bitcoin, we have a Bitcoin Office, we have the Bitcoin Law, bitcoin can be used in El Salvador. It hasn’t been an easy road,” Mayorga summarized.For Lemus, because “the government has its bitcoin reserve and will buy more” it is necessary “to have transparency, for citizens to know how public funds are being invested.” Bukele recently said he is convinced that with Donald Trump – whom he supports – in the White House there will be “an exponential revaluation” of the cryptocurrency. He frequently posts price increases on his social networks. For now, he remains silent.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Maybe don&apos;t get that close to a Plesiosaurus</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFHjhxLNt-o</link><author>PBS Eons</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bFHjhxLNt-o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 23:25:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA">PBS Eons</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[*****

[...] NetChoice's latest suit opposes the Maryland Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, a rule that echoes a California law of a similar name. In the California litigation, NetChoice notched a partial win in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the district court's decision to block a part of the law requiring platforms to file reports about their services' impact on kids. (It sent another part of the law back to the lower court for further review.)
 
A similar provision in Maryland's law is at the center of NetChoice's complaint. The group says that Maryland's reporting requirement lets regulators subjectively determine the "best interests of children," inviting "discriminatory enforcement." The reporting requirement on tech companies essentially mandates them "to disparage their services and opine on far-ranging and ill-defined harms that could purportedly arise from their services' 'design' and use of information," NetChoice alleges. NetChoice points out that both California and Maryland have passed separate online privacy laws, which NetChoice Litigation Center director Chris Marchese says shows that "lawmakers know how to write laws to protect online privacy when what they want to do is protect online privacy."
 
Supporters of the Maryland law say legislators learned from California's challenges and "optimized" their law to avoid questions about speech, according to Tech Policy Press. In a blog analyzing Maryland's approach, Future of Privacy Forum points out that the state made some significant changes from California's version -- such as avoiding an "express obligationâ to determine users' ages and defining the "best interests of children." The NetChoice challenge will test how well those changes can hold up to First Amendment scrutiny. NetChoice has consistently maintained that even well-intentioned attempts to protect kids online are likely to backfire. Though the Maryland law does not explicitly require the use of specific age verification tools, Marchese says it essentially leaves tech platforms with a no-win decision: collect more data on users to determine their ages and create varied user experiences or cater to the lowest common denominator and self-censor lawful content that might be considered inappropriate for its youngest users. And similar to its arguments in other cases, Marchese worries that collecting more data to identify users as minors could create a "honey pot" of kids' information, creating a different problem in attempting to solve another.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Everyone knows your location (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/130</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/130/changelog-news-130.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tim Sh tracked himself down through in-app ads, Sniffnet comfortably monitors your Internet traffic, Cate Huston opines on what makes a good team, Victor Shepelev draws on 25 years of coding to share seven things he now knows & Grant Slatton tells you how to write a good design document.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

The stadium’s latest $560M renovation–from the concession stands to the seating bowl–helped save it from demolition after Hurricane Katrina. NFL games have increasingly become more expensive with the addition of amenities like luxury field suites and club lounges, but all of these redesigns are done in order to increase revenue and efficiency.

WSJ spoke with the architect behind the Superdome’s plan, who explains how stadium design is evolving to create more revenue streams.

In 2013, incarcerated individuals in California’s Pelican Bay Prison assembled a historic hunger strike to protest decades-long sentences of solitary confinement. The defiance united over 30,000 inmates from diverse backgrounds in a powerful display of solidarity. This act garnered national attention and shed light on the inhumane conditions of The SHU (Security Housing Units). “The Strike” highlights the strength of prisoner-led resistance and the transformative power of collective organizing.

I've been there twice, and both times been involved in messy brawls despite not tasting a lick of alcohol. The second of these fisticuffs was against a small group of Cuman deserters. They seemed nice enough, but I was still wary considering the Cumans are who killed my parents a few months back. I wasn't the only one, and after failing to ease the growing tension, I decided to side with the local townspeople when push came to shove.Needless to say, we didn't put up much of a fight. Once the Cumans left, one of the locals implored me to track them down and deal with them once and for all. After eventually tracking them down, the sole Czech-speaking Cuman was so welcoming that I ended up getting drunk with them. I got so inebriated, in fact, that my night revolved around almost drowning, playing matchmaker for one of the soldiers, and then having a conversation with a talking dog that definitely wasn't real. This night of revelry would've been fine on any other evening, but I promised two new acquaintances that I'd be up bright and early to join them on a critical mission. Even after sleeping for seven hours, I was still completely plastered when I arose from my stupor. And let me tell you, fighting bandits with blurred vision, a swaying body, and a soundtrack of frequent farting isn't ideal.To some, this last part might sound utterly infuriating. To me, and others like me, this is part of what makes Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 utterly enticing. This is a game that sings when you're swept up in an entertaining series of events ignited by the consequences of your actions; where the game's quest design and emphasis on player choice wonderfully intertwine with its systems-driven sandbox to create a wholly immersive experience. While its 2018 predecessor was often disrupted by technical issues--which were further exacerbated by a frustrating save system--and clunky combat, Kingdom Come 2 refines and improves upon it in every respect. The obtuse nature of some of its RPG systems still won't click for everybody, but this is a confident sequel that builds on the foundations established by the original game, presenting a rich and sprawling adventure that effortlessly oscillates between medieval drama and slice-of-life hijinks in a world that feels distinctly alive.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sid Meier&apos;s Civilization VII Review - A Fine But Flawed Foundation</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review/1900-6418332/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f</link><author>Jason Rodriguez</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/123/1239113/4436780-civilization-vii-review-.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/reviews">GameSpot - Game Reviews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sid Meier's Civilization VII is the newest mainline entry in Firaxis' long-running 4X strategy series, which is built on exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating across procedurally generated maps. Taken on its own, each campaign remains a superbly engaging escapade across eras that will keep you playing for "one more turn" until you realize you're late for your sister's birthday party. Civilization VII is not just a game that you play to pass the time during weekends--the experience is compelling enough that it  the weekend, and maybe several weekdays of your life, too.For Civilization VII, Firaxis has made some sweeping changes, most notably with how you progress through each historical period. Several of these new features are welcome, given that they address concerns from previous titles while also making campaigns more dynamic. However, a few design decisions are bound to be contentious, especially for longtime fans, since these mechanics tend to impact the player's control over certain outcomes.One of the biggest changes in Civilization VII is how you choose leaders and nations separately. Gone are the days when picking Augustus Caesar or Napoleon meant automatically playing as Rome or France, respectively. Instead, leaders have a unique trait that defines their playstyle, and you can select a country independently to complement that playstyle.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>@krausefx about a scary #iPhone Camera Feature, that has now been resolved</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO6epHFkG_Y</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/sO6epHFkG_Y?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 13:01:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out the full version on our YouTube channel now! #GOTOcon #GOTOcph #Privacy #Mobile #HowIsFelixToday #FelixKrause #KrauseFX #Fastlane #Security #InAppBrowsers #SFSafari #iOS #Apple #Safari #Android #JavaScript #TikTok #Instagram #Viral #ViralShorts #GOTO

Like other pieces by Agile advocates, it's long on accolades for Agile, but short on hard evidence justifying why exactly Agile project management "has emerged as a critical component for firms looking to improve project delivery speed and flexibility" and the use of Agile approaches is being expanded across other departments beyond software development. Indeed, among the three examples of success offered in the piece to "highlight the effectiveness of agile methods in navigating complex stakeholder dynamics and achieving project success" is Atlassian's use of agile practices to market and develop its products, many of which are coincidentally designed to support Agile practices and teams (including Jira). How meta. 

Citing "recent studies," the piece concludes its call for stakeholder engagement by noting that "59% of organizations measure Agile success by customer or user satisfaction." But that is one of those metrics that can create perverse incentives. Empirical studies of user satisfaction and engagement have been published since the 1970's, and sadly one of the cruel lessons learned from them is that the easiest path to having satisfied users is to avoid working on difficult problems. Keep that in mind when you ponder why difficult user stories seem to languish forever in the Kanban and Scrum Board "Ice Box" column, while the "Complete" column is filled with low-hanging fruit. Sometimes success does come easy! So, are you in the Agile-is-Heaven or Agile-is-Hell camp?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Primary Hustle For Homeless in Vegas</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOwJF7Smr2M</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/VOwJF7Smr2M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 19:59:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Andrew and Glen go scavenging for copper wire, which is one of the primary hustles for the homeless in Vegas]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Facebook Admits Linux-Post Crackdown Was &apos;In Error&apos;, Fixes Moderation Error</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/02/1837253/facebook-admits-linux-post-crackdown-was-in-error-fixes-moderation-error?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 19:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tom's Hardware reports:

Facebook's heavy-handed censorship of Linux groups and topics was "in error," the social media juggernaut has admitted. Responding to reports earlier this week, sparked by the curious censorship of the eminently wholesome DistroWatch, Facebook contacted PCMag to say that it had made a mistake and that the underlying issue had been rectified. 

"This enforcement was in error and has since been addressed. Discussions of Linux are allowed on our services," said a Meta rep to PCMag. That is the full extent of the statement reproduced by the source... Copenhagen-hosted DistroWatch says it has appealed against the Community Standards-triggered ban shortly after it noticed it was in effect (January 19). PCMag received the Facebook admission of error on January 28. The latest statement from DistroWatch, which now prefers posting on Mastodon, indicates that Facebook has lifted the DistroWatch links ban. 


More details from PCMag:

Meta didn't say what caused the crackdown in the first place. But the company has been revamping some of its content moderation and plans to replace its fact-checking methodology with a user-driven Community Notes, similar to X. "We're also going to change how we enforce our policies to reduce the kind of mistakes that account for the vast majority of the censorship on our platforms," the company said earlier this month, in another irony. 
"Up until now, we have been using automated systems to scan for all policy violations, but this has resulted in too many mistakes and too much content being censored that shouldn't have been," Meta added in the same post.

According to a copy of his résumé obtained by WIRED, he spent three months at Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company, last summer.Both Bobba and Coristine are listed in internal OPM records reviewed by WIRED as “experts” at OPM, reporting directly to Amanda Scales, its new chief of staff. Scales previously worked on talent for xAI, Musk’s artificial intelligence company, and as part of Uber’s talent acquisition team, per LinkedIn. Employees at GSA tell WIRED that Coristine has appeared on calls where workers were made to go over code they had written and justify their jobs. WIRED previously reported that Coristine was added to a call with GSA staff members using a nongovernment Gmail address. Employees were not given an explanation as to who he was or why he was on the calls.Kliger, whose LinkedIn lists him as a special adviser to the director of OPM and who is listed in internal records reviewed by WIRED as a special adviser to the director for information technology, attended UC Berkeley until 2020; most recently, according to his LinkedIn, he worked for the AI company Databricks. His Substack includes a post titled “The Curious Case of Matt Gaetz: How the Deep State Destroys Its Enemies,” as well as another titled “Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense: The Warrior Washington Fears.”Killian, also known as Cole Killian, has a working email associated with DOGE, where he is currently listed as a volunteer, according to internal records reviewed by WIRED. According to a copy of his now-deleted résumé obtained by WIRED, he attended McGill University through at least 2021 and graduated high school in 2019. An archived copy of his now-deleted personal website indicates that he worked as an engineer at Jump Trading, which specializes in algorithmic and high-frequency financial trades.Shaotran told Business Insider in September that he was a senior at Harvard studying computer science and also the founder of an OpenAI-backed startup, Energize AI. Shaotran was the runner-up in a hackathon held by xAI, Musk’s AI company. In the Business Insider article, Shaotran says he received a $100,000 grant from OpenAI to build his scheduling assistant, Spark.Are you a current or former employee with the Office of Personnel Management or another government agency impacted by Elon Musk?

The source, who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity because they fear retaliation, says they worry that the new teams could bypass the regular security clearance protocols to access the agency’s sensitive compartmented information facility, as the Trump administration has already granted temporary security clearances to unvetted people.This is in addition to Coristine and Bobba being listed as “experts” working at OPM. Bednar says that while staff can be loaned out between agencies for special projects or to work on issues that might cross agency lines, it’s not exactly common practice.“This is consistent with the pattern of a lot of tech executives who have taken certain roles of the administration,” says Bednar. “This raises concerns about regulatory capture and whether these individuals may have preferences that don’t serve the American public or the federal government.”Additional reporting by Zoë Schiffer and Tim Marchman.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Everyone knows your location: tracking myself down through in-app ads</title><link>https://timsh.org/tracking-myself-down-through-in-app-ads/</link><author>apokryptein</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 17:07:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently I read about a massive geolocation data leak from Gravy Analytics, which exposed more than 2000 apps, both in AppStore and Google Play, that secretly collect geolocation data without user consent. Oftentimes, even without developers` knowledge. I looked into the list (link here) and found at least 3 apps I have installed on my iPhone. Take a look for yourself! This made me come up with an idea to track myself down externally, e.g. to buy my geolocation data leaked by some application. After more than couple dozen hours of trying, here are the main takeaways: I found a couple requests sent by my phone with + 5 requests that leak , which can be turned into geolocation using reverse DNS. Learned a lot about the RTB (real-time bidding) auctions and OpenRTB protocol and was shocked by the amount and types of data sent with the bids to ad exchanges. Gave up on the idea to buy my location data from a data broker or a tracking service, because I don't have a big enough company to take a trial or $10-50k to buy a huge database with the data of millions of people + me. Well maybe I do, but such expense seems a bit irrational. Turns out that EU-based peoples` data is almost the most expensive. But still, I know my location data was collected and I know where to buy it! My setup for this research included:My old iPhone 11 restored to factory defaults + new apple id. Felt too uncomfortable to do all this on my current phone. Charles Proxy to record all traffic coming in and out. I set up the SSL certificate on the iPhone to decrypt all https traffic.A simple game called Stack by KetchApp - I remember playing it at school 10-12 years ago. Choosing it as a lab rat felt nostalgic. To my surprise, there were a lot of KetchApp games on the list. Ok, here we go: only 1 app installed without the default Apple ones, Charles on, launching Stack in 3, 2, 1.... These are the requests that the app sends in the first minute after launch. Take a look at the timing of the requests - almost every split second. Let's take a look at the contents of the requests. I actually checked every single one of them - but I'll leave out only the interesting ones here. Let's start with the juiciest request sent to https://o.isx.unity3d.com - the first one that included my geo, while I disabled Location Services on iPhone for all apps! If you are as naive as I was before this, you might be surprised - what does Unity, the 3D engine, have to do with the in-app advertisement or location tracking? Perhaps that's just some monitoring data to help improve the engine? Turns out that Unity's main revenue stream (they made $2 bln+ in 2023) is Unity Ads - "Mobile Game Ad Network". Sounds quite interesting.Below is the request body in json format sent to Unity Ads. I will only leave the  fields worth mentioning - the actual size is 200+ keys. {
  "ts": "2025-01-18T23:27:39Z", // Timestamp
  "c": "ES", // Country code,
  "d": "sports.bwin.es", // Domain; the app or website where the ad will be displayed.
  "bn": "molocoads-eu-banner", // WTF is moloco ads? We'll see!
  "cip": "181.41.[redacted]", // my IP !!
  "dm": "iPhone12,1", 
  "ct": "2", // Connection type; e.g., Wi-Fi
  "car": "Yoigo", // mobile network operator
  "ifv": "6B00D8E5-E37B-4EA0-BB58-[redacted]", // ID for Vendor. We'll get back to it!
  "lon": "2.[redacted]", // Longitude ... 
  "lat": "41.[redacted]", // Latitude ... 
  "sip": "34.227.224.225", // Server IP (Amazon AWS in US) 
  "uc": "1", // User consent for tracking = True; OK what ?!
}Ok, so my IP + location + timestamp + some  id are shared with Unity → Moloco Ads → Bwin, and then I see the actual Bwin ad in the game. Wonderful! As a quick note - location shared was not very precise (but still in the same postal index), I guess due to the fact that iPhone was connected to WiFi and had no SIM installed. If it was LTE, I bet the lat/lon would be much more precise. Hello Facebook... What are you doing here?Next interesting request that leaks my IP + timestamp (= geo-datapoint) is Facebook.What?!I don't have any Meta [Facebook] app installed on this iPhoneI didn't link the app nor my Apple ID to any Facebook accountI didn't consent to Facebook getting my IP address!{ 
	"bundles": {
		"bidder_token_info": {
			"data": {
				"bt_extras": {
                  "ip":"181.41.[redacted], // nice Extras, bro
                  "ts":1737244649
			},
			"fingerprint": null
		},
        {
          "a lot of data: yes a loooooooot"
         }We'll talk more about this one in the next section. Why do you need my screen brightness level? {
  "osVersion":"16.7.1",
  "connectionType":"wifi",
  "eventTimeStamp":1737244651,
  "vendorIdentifier":"6B00D8E5-E37B-[redacted]", // ifv once again 
  "wiredHeadset":false, // excuse me? 
  "volume":0.5,
  "cpuCount":6,
  "systemBootTime":1737215978,
  "batteryStatus":3,
  "screenBrightness":0.34999999403953552,
  "freeMemory":507888,
  "totalMemory":3550640, // is this RAM?
  "timeZone":"+0100",
  "deviceFreeSpace":112945148
  "networkOperator":"6553565535"
  "advertisingTrackingId":"00000000-0000....", // interesting ...
  }There's no "personal information" here, but honestly this amount of data shared with an arbitrary list of 3rd parties is scary. Why do they need to know my screen brightness, memory amount, current volume and if I'm wearing headphones? I know the "right" answer - to help companies target their audience better! For example, if you're promoting a mobile app that is 1 GB of size, and the user only has 500 MB of space left - don't show him the ad, right?But I also heard lots of controversies on this topic. Like Uber dynamically adjusting taxi price based on your battery level - because you're not waiting for a cheaper option with 4% left while standing in the street. I can't know if that or another one is true. But the fact that this data is available and accessible by advertisers suggests that they should at least think of using it. Ok, enough with the requests. We can already see the examples of different ip and geolocation leaks.  + timestamp was adjust.com - but the request body was too boring to include. You might've already noticed  and  ==  in the requests above - what are those? IFV, or IDFV, is "ID for Vendor". This is my id unique for each vendor, a.k.a developer - in this case, KetchApp. This checks out: I installed another KetchApp game to quickly record the requests, and the  value was the same for it. Advertising Tracking ID, on the other hand, is the cross-vendor value, the one that is shared with an app if you choose "Allow app to track your activity across ...". As you can see above, it was actually set to  because I "Asked app not to track". I checked this by manually disabling and enabling tracking option for the Stack app and comparing requests in both cases. And that's the only difference between allowing and disallowing trackingI understand there might be nothing shocking to you in it - this is not really kept secret, you can go and check the docs for Apple developers, for example. But I believe this is  communicated correctly to the end users, you and me, in any adequate way, shape or form: the free apps you install and use collect your precise location with timestamp and send it to some 3rd-party companies. The only thing that stops anyone with access to bid data (yet another ad buying agent, or ad exchange, or a dataset bought or rented from data broker, as you'll see later) from tracking you down with all trips you make daily is this  that is not shared when you disallow apps to "track you across apps" to "enhance and personalise your ads experience". By the way: if you're using 10 apps from the same vendor (Playrix, KetchApp or another 1000-app company) and allow  to track you – it would mean that the data collected in all 10 apps will be enriched with your IDFA which can later be exchanged to your personal data. At the same time, there is so much data in the requests that I'd expect ad exchanges to find some loophole ID that would allow cross-app tracking without the need for IDFA. I found at least 20 ids like  and ,  and  (these 2 are shared with Facebook), and so on. By the way, the fact that Facebook collected my IP + timestamp without any adequate consent / app connection from my end is crazy. I think Facebook is more than capable of connecting the dots and my Meta Account to this hit as soon as I login to Instagram or Facebook app on the same IP address. Let's get back to the request that leaked my location for a second and look at its trace. We'll focus on the parties in the middle:stack →  o.isx.unity3d.com → molocoads → bwin (advertiser)Unity [ads] is an SSP (supply-side platform) that acts as a collector of data from the app via SDK. As an app developer, you don't need to worry about gathering the right data, registering as a publisher on an ad exchange or whatever - just install the SDK and receive the money. Moloco ads is a DSP network that resells data from multiple SSPs (like Unity, Applovin, Chartboost). Basically, from almost every one of the requested hosts I've seen pop up in Charles Proxy.It then applies some "smart optimisation" and connects a vacant banner space on your phone screen with the advertiser.Sounds like moloco aggregates a lot of data and basically anyone (- any company that becomes an ad partner) can access the data by bidding lower than others. Or imagine a real ad exchange that bids normally and collects all of the data along the way "as a side gig". Basically, this is how intelligence companies and data brokers get their data. At this point I was looking for any mentions of Moloco on Telegram and Reddit, and I ran into this post that answered a lot of my questions:They access it if they integrate with the provider of bidstream, which would be the SSP. It's on the SSP to verify the vendor to whom they give access to bids. Usually, the requirement would be that you actually... bid. SSPs want you to spend money, that's how their business makes revenue. They might open up only part of the traffic to specific vendors (i.e.. if you don't bid worldwide, you won't get the bidstream worldwide, only in the regions in which you operate).Let's move further. When I found out how the data gets out, I started looking for any place where it's being sold. It was a quick search.I found a data marketplace called Datarade which is a panel with all sorts of data. When I searched for MAID-specific data, hundreds of options showed up, like these two: The price of the Redmob dataset surprised me, - $120k a year... for what?Let's now take a look at their promo:Check out the list of features on the right - do any of them look familiar? : "low latency" means they know your location from the last time any of the apps shared it. It can be as little as 5 seconds ago. What's even better is that Redmob provides a  of the data. I tried to request it from their website, but the sample never landed in my mailbox (surprise-surprise, timsh.org doesn't seem like a customer with high potential). Thankfully, this sample is public on Databricks Marketplace with this annotation:Enhance your products and services using our global location data covering over 1.5 billion devices. Using our extensive location dataset, you can unearth concealed patterns, conduct rapid analyses, and obtain profound knowledge.We can also provide region-specific data (MENA, Africa, APAC, etc.) based on your specific requirements. Our pricing model includes an annual licensing option, and we provide free sample data so that you can evaluate the quality of our dataset for yourself. To me, the most absurd part is the  column - the source of the data can't be more obvious. I'm also quite interested in the  column - if it's the birthyear, where did they get it from? Never mind, who cares about your birthyear.All right, imagine I bought the access to a huge stream of Redmob data. But my goal is to track and stalk people like myself or anyone else, so I need some way to exchange MAIDs () for the actual personal info: name, address, phone number... No problem! This kind of dataset is surprisingly also present on Datarade. Take a look at a sample table with  type that is provided by "AGR Marketing Solutions":Inside - all personal info (full name, email, phone number, physical address, property ownership... and IDFAs. Congrats, you have just reached the bottom of this rabbit hole. Let's wrap it up and make a couple of bold statements.How to track yourself down?Easy! Just follow this simple step-by-step guide:Use some free apps for a bit. Move around and commute - this makes the geo data more valuable. "Allow" or "ask not to track" - a combo of IP + location + User-agent + geolocation will still be leaked to hundreds of "3rd parties" regardless of your choice.Wait for a few seconds until fake DSPs and data brokers receive your data.Exchange your full name or phone number for an IDFA (if present), IP address and user-agent through the  data purchased somewhere.Now, access the "Mobility data" consisting of geolocation history, and filter it using the values from the previous step. Congratulations! You found yourself. I created a flowchart that includes almost all actors and data mentioned above - now you can see how it's all connected. This is the worst thing about these data trades that happen constantly around the world - each small part of it is (or seems) legit. It's the bigger picture that makes them look ugly. Thanks for reading this story until the end!My research was heavily influenced by these posts and investigations: ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Technology Can Save The World | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODqJuV8v4y8</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ODqJuV8v4y8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 16:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This video is a compilation of clips filmed from 2022.

Animal welfare focuses on animals’ well-being, particularly of those under human care or ownership. Protection laws aim to ensure that animals’ physical, mental, and environmental needs are met, while allowing their owners to make use of them (for food or labor, for example) without inflicting any “unnecessary suffering.”   

Advocates of animal rights, on the other hand, believe animals should be legally protected from all forms of exploitation. Many proponents say people should not be allowed to farm animals, use them in laboratories, injure or kill them. 

Both views are based on the idea that most animals are sentient beings, which can think and feel and therefore have personal interests which should be respected.

"The teachers faded away pretty quickly," Gates adds, "But about six of us stayed hardcore. One was Paul Allen..." — the future co-founder of Microsoft. And the experience clearly meant a lot to Gates. "Microsoft just never would've happened without Paul — and this teletype room." 

In a longer post thanking his "brilliant" teachers, Gates calls his teletype experience "an encounter that would shape my entire future" and "opened up a whole new world for me." Gates also thanks World War II Navy pilot and Boeing engineer Bill Dougall, who "was instrumental in bringing computer access to our school, something he and other faculty members pushed for after taking a summer computer class... The fascinating thing about Mr. Dougall was that he didn't actually know much about programming; he exhausted his knowledge within a week. But he had the vision to know it was important and the trust to let us students figure it out." 

Gates shared a similar memory about the computer-room's 20-something overseer Fred Wright, who "intuitively understood that the best way to get students to learn was to let us explore on our own terms. There was no sign-up sheet, no locked door, no formal instruction."

Instead, Mr. Wright let us figure things out ourselves and trusted that, without his guidance, we'd have to get creative... Some of the other teachers argued for tighter regulations, worried about what we might be doing in there unsupervised. But even though Mr. Wright occasionally popped in to break up a squabble or listen as someone explained their latest program, for the most part he defended our autonomy... 
Mr. Wright gave us something invaluable: the space to discover our own potential.

On Monday, over a trillion dollars was wiped off the US stock market due to the appearance of a Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek.

The release of a new reasoning model, known as R1, led investors to question US dominance in tech, their expectations around future AI capex while also raising the prospect that China might beat Silicon Valley at its own game.

The new DeepSeek model can “reason” to solve complex problems and performs as well as the AI software from US tech giants like Google and OpenAI, but was apparently developed at a fraction of the price of those models.

DeepSeek quickly overtook OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the US iOS App store.

Two images of child rape are shared online every second. Social networks make it especially easy for sex offenders to prey on victims.

Back in 2009, the United Nations estimated that 750,000 pedophiles were online at any one time. Fifteen years later, experts believe that figure has tripled. Believing themselves to be shielded by the apparent anonymity of chatrooms, these men - most of the perpetrators are men - exchange ideas on how best to approach and manipulate a child into supplying explicit material.
They also give each other tips on how to rape a child known to them and share images with others without being caught. Some enquire about commissioning the rape of a child to their exact specifications on the other side of the world - and to witness this live via Skype or WhatsApp for less than a hundred dollars. 
A nightmare that is part of everyday life for child protection organizations and law enforcement agencies, who are faced with the challenge of identifying victims of abuse, tracking down the perpetrators and preventing the proliferation of pedocriminal content.
For four years, director Laetitia Ohnona observed the day-to-day work of relevant agencies in Germany, France, Britain, North America and the Philippines: accompanying French police from the new central office for the protection of minors, undercover American special agents from the Homeland Security Investigations agency,  the Public Prosecutor General’s Office in Frankfurt and German police officers responsible for taking down darknet pages, as well as employees of reporting platforms tracking down pedocriminal content. On a visit to the European Commission, she learned that it plans to impose stricter rules on IT companies.

ABSTRACT
The software industry is changing faster than ever. Now, with microservices becoming more and more accepted as an approach to systems architecture, the rate of change of our industry and of the software we write is getting faster and faster.

In this talk, James explores what this means for developers writing code now. Do we abandon our quest to build quality in? What does it mean for design if we are building software explicitly to throw it away a short time later. Is TDD dead? What does software craftsmanship look like through the lens of replaceable code in small replaceable services?

In short, what does it mean if we are #neverdone?

They were all telling one another the same thing: Data on the website were about to disappear, or be altered, to comply with the Trump administration’s ongoing attempt to scrub federal agencies of any mention of gender, DEI, and accessibility. “I was up until 2 a.m.,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan who relies on the CDC’s data to track viral outbreaks, told me. She archived whatever she could.The full scope of the purge isn’t yet clear. One document obtained by  indicated that the government was, as of yesterday evening, intending to target and replace, at a minimum, several “suggested keywords”—including “pregnant people, transgender, binary, non-binary, gender, assigned at birth, binary [], non-binary [], cisgender, queer, gender identity, gender minority, anything with pronouns”—in CDC content. While these terms are often politicized, some represent demographic variables that researchers collect when tracking the ebb and flow of diseases and health conditions across populations. Should they be reworded, or even removed entirely, from data sets to comply with the executive order, researchers and health-care providers might have a much harder time figuring out how diseases affect specific communities—making it more challenging to serve Americans on the whole.CDC data’s “explicit purpose” is to guide researchers toward the places and people who most need attention, Patrick Sullivan, an epidemiologist at Emory University and a former CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, told me. As the changes unfold before him, he said, “it’s hard to understand how this benefits health.”When I contacted the CDC, a spokesperson redirected my requests for comment to the Department of Health and Human Services. After this story was published, an HHS spokesperson said that “all changes to the HHS website and HHS division websites are in accordance with President Trump’s January 20 Executive Orders” on gender and DEI.The government appears to understand that these changes could have scientific implications: The document directing a review of CDC content suggests that some work could be altered without “changing the meaning or scientific integrity of the content,” and that any such changes should be considered “routine.” Changing other content, according to the document, would require review by an expert precisely because any alterations would risk scientific integrity. But the document does not specify how data would be sorted into those categories, or at whose discretion.“My fear is that in the short term, entire data sets would be taken down,” then reappear with demographic variables removed or altered to conform with DEI restrictions, Katie Biello, an epidemiologist at Brown, told me. Excising mention of gender and sexual orientation, for instance, from public-health data sets could require stripping entire columns of data out. If the government chooses to define sex as binary, transgender people and nonbinary people, among others, could be effectively erased. In response to the ongoing changes, some groups of researchers are now rushing to archive the CDC website in full.Acknowledging and addressing health differences among demographic groups is a basic epidemiological tenet, Biello told me, “so we know where to target our health interventions.” She pointed to examples in her own field: Gay men have higher rates of STIs, but lower rates of obesity; transgender women have higher rates of HIV, but lower rates of prostate cancer. More broadly, demographic changes to data sets could limit the country’s ability to identify which Americans are most at risk from an expansive list of conditions including adolescent depression, STIs, even sex-specific cancers. Changing data sets in this way would be tantamount to “erasing our ability to use data and evidence” to care for people, Rachel Hardeman, a health-equity expert at the University of Minnesota, told me.Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Brown, pointed to mpox as a recent example of how replacing “gender” with “sex,” or ignoring sexual orientation, could limit effective public-health responses. At the beginning of the United States’ 2022 outbreak, neither researchers nor the public had much clarity on who was most affected, leading to widespread panic. “Officials were talking about the situation as if it was a risk we equally faced,” Nuzzo said. By collecting detailed demographic information, researchers were able to show that the disease was primarily affecting men who have sex with men, allowing officials to more efficiently allocate resources, including vaccines, and bring the epidemic under control before it affected Americans more widely.A scrub such as this could also change how the government allocates funds for long-standing threats to public health, which could widen health-equity gaps, or reverse progress in combatting them. Rates of STIs more generally have recently begun to plateau in the U.S., after decades of steady increase—but altering data that focus interventions on, say, transgender populations, or men who have sex with men, could undo those gains. If no data exist to prove that a health issue concentrates within a particular community, that “provides a justification to cut funding,” one researcher told me. (Several scientists who spoke with me for this article requested anonymity, for fear of retaliation for speaking out about the loss of federal data.) Sullivan, whose work focuses on HIV surveillance, compared the government’s actions to, effectively, destroying the road map to determining who in America most needs screening, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and treatment.Much of the data on the CDC website have been aggregated from states, so it would be possible for researchers to reassemble those data sets, Nuzzo pointed out. But that’s an onerous task, and several scientists told me they never thought they’d be in a position where they’d have to scramble to squirrel away publicly available federal data. Nuzzo also worried that states might be reluctant in the future to share data with the federal government, or might decide not to bother collecting certain data at all. On the most basic scientific level, changing federal-government data means those data become unreliable. Public-health data are collected with the intention of sussing out which populations most need health interventions; altering those data leaves behind a skewed portrait of reality.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Android 16&apos;s Linux Terminal Runs Doom</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/31/2317212/android-16s-linux-terminal-runs-doom?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Feb 2025 01:40:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google is enhancing Android 16's Linux Terminal app to support graphical Linux applications, so Android Authority decided to put it to the test by running Doom. From the report: The Terminal app first appeared in the Android 15 QPR2 beta as a developer option, and it still remains locked behind developer settings. Since its initial public release, Google pushed a few changes that fixed issues with the installation process and added a settings menu to resize the disk, forward ports, and backup the installation. However, the biggest changes the company has been working on, which include adding hardware acceleration support and a full graphical environment, have not been pushed to any public releases.
 
Thankfully, since Google is working on this feature in the open, it's possible to simply compile a build of AOSP with these changes added in. This gives us the opportunity to trial upcoming features of the Android Linux Terminal app before a public release. To demonstrate, we fired up the Linux Terminal on a Pixel 9 Pro, tapped a new button on the top right to enter the Display activity, and then ran the 'weston' command to open up a graphical environment. (Weston is a reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, a modern display server protocol.)
 
We also went ahead and enabled hardware acceleration beforehand as well as installed Chocolate Doom, a source port of Doom, to see if it would run. Doom did run, as you can see below. It ran well, which is no surprise considering Doom can run on literal potatoes. There wasn't any audio because an audio server isn't available yet, but audio support is something that Google is still working on.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why This D.C.

It turns out that if you include any expletives in your search query, Google will not return an AI Overview, as they are called, at the top of the results page.For instance, if you search “How large is the student body of Yale University?” the search results page will return a large AI-generated blurb above the blue links. If you instead search, “How large is the fucking student body at Yale University?” you will instead get a standard list of blue link results, sans-AI summary.This is not the first time internet sleuths have discovered a way to disable Google’s AI-powered results. Other methods are more complicated, however, like adding a specific string of characters to the search results page URL. This method of swearing and pleading at Google to “just give me the fucking links” is much more cathartic.We are going to go out on a limb here and say that if people are regularly finding techniques to disable AI summaries in Google searches, perhaps that means they do not want them in the first place? Google search results have never been perfect, of course—there is still a lot of poor information across the web. But AI summaries present users with a prominent blurb at the top of their search that looks authoritative when it just risks compounding the misinformation problem with more erroneous slop.It is the same way Siri has been made worse by its integration with ChatGPT. At least in the past, when the voice assistant did not know how to answer a question it would just throw users to the web. Now Siri offers up ChatGPT-generated responses instead, sometimes spitting out incorrect nonsense instead of admitting it is not sure. But this is all being forced on users whether they like it or not. From Google Docs to X and Instagram, there are AI buttons and search boxes and dropdowns everywhere now, because every tech company needs to have an AI strategy. Is a basic keyword search too much to ask?When Google first introduced AI Overviews into search, it went viral for returning nonsensical responses, such as suggesting that one can prevent cheese from sliding off their pizzas by using glue or improve gut health by eating pebbles. It is believed Google’s model sourced the information from Reddit comments. AI does not know how to identify sarcasm or satire. earlier reported on the new loophole, which, if we are speculating, is caused by Google’s overly cautious steering of its AI model. Whereas a bot like xAI’s Grok is more than happy to swear and discuss sensitive topics, Google’s Gemini keeps it PG. Google has likely trained Gemini to avoid repeating expletives, so it simply is disabled in search when a curse word is present in order to avoid that.Google has argued that AI Overviews, as they are called, do not reduce traffic sent to websites because users will view summaries and be interested in delving deeper into the source material after finding something of interest. That logic has not comforted media companies, which have been litigating the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity for ingesting their content into large language models.We imagine Google will close the expletive loophole eventually, but in the meantime, if you are sick of AI, you now know an easy way to avoid it. Just tell Google to give you the fucking links.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Over the top auth strategies (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/78</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/78/changelog--friends-78.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dan Moore from FusionAuth joins us for a wide-ranging discussion about modern auth strategies.

For some people, it gets in the way of taking risks and living the life they dream of. For others, it keeps them trapped in negative feelings. The stronger the shame, the more we try to hide it from others.

This is precisely what gives shame so much destructive power over us. In this documentary, three people tell their stories. They share their personal experiences, and the consequences of their shame: Addiction, self-harm, depression. Experts explain why we feel ashamed in the first place, how shame influences our self-image and how we can find a way out of this painful feeling. 

Because shame hurts. At the same time, shame is crucial to helping us to live together. Shame turns us into social beings, who have internalized the norms and rules of the community. To what extent shame benefits coexistence is also a topic of research. In view of social media, do we need more shame, as a moral cement, so that we behave more respectfully towards each other? Or would less shame be better?

The story of Chrissy Teigen’s paternal great-grandparents was largely unknown to her. Research determines that she is descended from multiple generations of musicians, and from the Sinti people, a subgroup of the Romani people. The Roma, or Romani people were often denigrated as Gypsies, but it explains why Teigen’s ancestors moved so often.

Chrissy Teigen is a New York Times #1 bestselling author, TV personality and the founder of food and lifestyle brand Cravings. In 2016, Teigen released “Cravings: Recipes for All the Food You Want to Eat” which debuted #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list and marked the first time a cookbook debuted #1 on USA Today's best-seller list. Teigen cohosted and executive produced “Chrissy & Dave Dine Out” with David Chang. She also executive produced and starred in “Chrissy’s Court”, executive produced the HBO Max documentary series “The Way Down”, and starred opposite Tina Fey and Nat Faxon in the Netflix animated comedy series “Mulligan”.

ABSTRACT
Playwright is the hottest browser automation tool on the market. You can use it for testing and web scraping, but also for production monitoring!

In this talk I’ll explain the basics of Playwright, show real life (code) examples and explain how to use browser automation for effective, high signal to noise production monitoring: I like to call this the “monitoring as code” workflow. After this talk, you will have the basic knowledge on using Playwright in your own dev pipeline and catch errors on production. [...]

Our ability to learn about phenomena and worlds that seem almost
impossibly out of reach, now give us an incredible insight into the universe we occupy, and how we got here.

Brian and Robin find out about some of the big new missions providing information into our own solar system and beyond, and find out what big questions in cosmology still remain a tantalising challenge?

Höss was brought in by top Nazis to pioneer the industrialisation of the mass murder of Europe's Jews and others. He lived in a house that shared a wall with Auschwitz, metres from the crematorium, where he and his family enjoyed a happy domestic life - his wife once described their life at the house as 'paradise'.The house was home to a Polish family until last year when it was taken over by the Counter Extremism Project who invited History Hit to explore the house, which is largely as it was when the Hoss family lived there. Dan travels to Poland with historian and best-selling author Thomas Harding to discover more about Höss' role in the Holocaust and what the house teaches us about 'the banality of evil'. They learn about what went on there, what Holocaust artefacts were recently found in the attic and the future of the house as a centre to combat hate.Warning: this episode contains descriptions of human suffering and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.With special thanks to the Counter Extremism Project, Dr Hans-Jakob Schindler, Keith Burnet and Thomas Harding.You can see the History Hit film about the house here:You can find out more in Thomas' book 'Hanns and Rudolf: The German Jew and the Hunt for the Kommandant of Auschwitz'. He also has a new book out for children.

According to quantum physics, the universe should have collapsed on itself in the instant after the Big Bang due to all particles being 100 million billion times heavier. Recent observations of the universe existing suggest that this may not have happened. Even more recent experiments at the Large Hardron Collider have failed to find out why. In particular, why the Higgs boson is light enough to allow the universe to exist. This is part of something known as the hierarchy problem, and some consider it to be the most important unsolved problem in physics.

It's a world I wanted to dive into from the jump, if only to uncover more of how it came to be and what the cultures of the different locations are like. And as much as the worldbuilding retains that wonder with incredible-looking environments that make for engaging play spaces for the physics-based magic system, the beat-for-beat details of Eternal Strands' story aren't nearly as rewarding to unravel.Eternal Strands' story too often hits on familiar fantasy tropes, such as an inexplicable magical disaster that changed everything and a corrupting force that seemingly has no weakness and must be avoided at all costs. But the history that story is built on adds a semblance of life to the world, building memorable NPCs that you want to come back to again and again to talk about what in their life led them to where they are now, and painting a somber undertone to the world that begs to be uncovered through its detailed lore notes and optional collectibles.I especially love how Eternal Strands packages aspects of its history so they're viewed through the art of weaving--not a typical choice for action-adventure games. Concepts like spells are recontextualized, transforming from arcane runes into fashion choices. You can largely avoid the historical exposition if you'd rather spend your time swinging a sword and spewing fire, but there's some great writing to uncover here for lore hounds.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Were Neandertals morning people?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSchvm7lLOw</link><author>PBS Eons</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vSchvm7lLOw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 17:15:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA">PBS Eons</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[*****

We provide an examination of SDcpp, its components, and the technical concepts that enable efficient inference of Stable Diffusion models on lower-end hardware such as CPUs and lightweight GPUs, such as Apple M-series chips. In particular, we’re looking at Flux.1, a text-to-image model developed by Black Forest Labs.Introduction to Diffusion Models and Stable DiffusionDiffusion models, specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), have emerged as powerful generative frameworks capable of producing high-fidelity images from random noise through iterative denoising processes. Stable Diffusion extends the DDPM framework by incorporating text conditioning, allowing for the generation of images based on descriptive prompts. However, the computational demands of such models typically necessitate high-memory, high-bandwidth GPU resources, limiting their accessibility and scalability.SDcpp addresses these limitations by providing an optimized inference framework that leverages techniques such as quantization, memory-efficient sampling, and optimized latent space representations to facilitate the deployment of Stable Diffusion models on devices with constrained computational resources. This paper delves into the architectural and algorithmic components of SDcpp, highlighting the methodologies that underpin its efficiency and performance.The architecture is composed of several interdependent modules, each contributing to the inference process. First, it is loading the required models (1), including text encoders, the diffusion model, and the VAE decoder. It then performs  (2), tokenizing the input prompt and generating text embeddings using a CLIP-based model and an additional T5XXL text conditioning model. Next, it computes the conditioning graph (3), transforming embeddings to create a guidance vector for the diffusion process. The system then  (4) by iteratively refining a randomly initialized latent tensor using a noise schedule and a chosen sampling method, progressively steering it towards a structured latent representation in a number of . This step is the most compute-intensive, consuming roughly 90% of the total processing time. Once sampling completes, the pipeline decodes the latent representation (5) using a VAE model to reconstruct pixel-space information. Finally, it  (6) as an image file, completing the text-to-image generation process.Diffusion Model Core ComponentsThe diffusion model within SDcpp is the principal generative engine, responsible for transforming Gaussian noise into coherent images through a series of denoising . More steps allow finer details and smoother outputs but increase inference time, as each step requires additional computation. This process is governed by the DDPM framework, wherein the model iteratively refines the image by removing noise in a controlled manner. The diffusion model encompasses three primary components:UNet (Denoising Network): the UNet architecture employs an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections, enabling multi-scale feature extraction and reconstruction. The network predicts and removes noise at each denoising step, progressively enhancing image quality.Text Encoder (Conditioning Module): The text encoder converts textual prompts into latent embeddings that guide the denoising process. SDcpp supports multiple text encoders, including CLIP-L, CLIP-G, and T5XXL, each tailored for different model versions and memory considerations.Scheduler (Noise Controller): The scheduler orchestrates the noise removal strategy, dictating the temporal progression of denoising steps. It determines the rate and manner in which noise is reduced, balancing computational efficiency and image fidelity.A recent model,  , is optimized for low-resource environments, featuring a compact UNet architecture that accelerates inference by reducing the number of denoising steps. Flux.1 is designed for memory-efficient quantization and compatibility with the GGUF format, making it suitable for deployment on lightweight hardware. It reduces inference steps to only 4 steps and can achieve fast inference.Variational Autoencoder (VAE)VAEs facilitating the encoding of images into a lower-dimensional latent space. This reduction significantly diminishes computational and memory overhead while retaining high-resolution image details. Latent space is a compact mathematical representation of an image. Think of it as a highly efficient shorthand where only the most essential details are stored. Instead of storing every pixel, the image is encoded as numbers that describe its features. This makes it possible to work with images at a much lower computational cost. Stable Diffusion doesn’t generate images pixel by pixel. Instead, it creates images in latent space, where information is stored in a more compact and manageable way. Once the model finishes generating an image in this space, the VAE  it back into a high-resolution format that we can see.Different VAEs can influence how well the final image looks. A generic VAE works for most images, but a model trained for a specific style, like anime or realistic photography, may use a custom VAE to better match its training data. A poorly matched VAE can cause color shifts, blurriness, or unwanted artifacts.Technically, any model can use any VAE, but results vary. A VAE trained on cartoon-style images won’t reconstruct a photorealistic image correctly. This is why some models provide their own VAEs — they have been optimized to maintain details that matter most for a specific style.LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)LoRA facilitates model customization without the need to adjust the entire diffusion model. By modifying only a small subset of parameters (~10 million), LoRA significantly reduces memory usage compared to full model fine-tuning. Multiple LoRAs can be combined with weighted influences on the final image, enabling diverse stylistic and feature modifications. For instance, combining two LoRAs with different weights can be executed using the syntax <lora:styleA:0.6> <lora:styleB:0.8>. To optimize performance, it is advisable to minimize the number and strength of LoRAs, especially in memory-limited environments.Training and Inference File FormatsThe  is the standard PyTorch checkpoint format, that stores full precision weights and optimizer states. Supports training and fine-tuning but can execute arbitrary Python code, posing security risks. SafeTensors (.safetensors) is a safer alternative to CKPT, with structured, immutable storage and no executable code. Loads faster but still used mainly for training.GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) is a binary model format introduced by llama.cpp, succeeding GGML. Initially designed for language models (like LLaMA models), GGUF has been adopted in diffusion models to enable efficient, quantized inference without reformatting model files into proprietary formats (e.g., .ggml or .gguf conversions required previously). Traditional formats (.safetensors, .ckpt, .bin) store full-precision FP16/FP32 model weights, consuming significant VRAM. GGUF introduces quantization at multiple levels, storing models in 2-bit to 16-bit precision while maintaining compatibility with SDcpp.Use GGUF for efficient inference on low-resource devices, prefer .safetensors for training.In our experiments,  demonstrates an extremely fast denoising process, with images at 1 and 2 steps appearing nearly identical, suggesting that most structural information is determined in the very first iterations. By 4 steps, images diverge significantly, and by 6 steps, they change even more, indicating that additional steps introduce large variations rather than just refining details. Interestingly, Euler and Euler_a produce the best results, likely because they follow a balanced noise reduction trajectory, allowing structure to form naturally without over-smoothing or excessive deviations. Euler introduces noticeable changes between 3, 4, and 6 steps, including shifts in pose, face, and hair color, implying that it follows a latent space trajectory where small step changes can drastically impact the final result. Euler_a, being an ancestral sampler, adds controlled randomness at each step, further amplifying these changes. In contrast, LCM performs poorly with Flux 1, excessively blurring images, likely due to its tuning for models that require more iterative refinement, making it unsuitable for Flux 1’s fast-converging architecture. We observed that 4 steps often produce better images than 5 or 6 steps, as extra iterations introduce unnecessary alterations instead of improving details, reinforcing that Flux 1 is optimized for extremely low-step inference. This is a stark contrast to Stable Diffusion models like SD 1.5 or SDXL, which typically require 20–50 steps for high-quality outputs. These findings highlight that Flux 1’s unique training favors fewer steps with the right sampler, making Euler and Euler_a better choices at around 4 steps, while models like LCM fail due to excessive denoising.Denoising Schedules and Sampling IntegrationDenoising schedules define a series of noise levels that guide reverse diffusion. These schedules set discrete or continuous noise decay steps, essentially parameterizing the stochastic differential equation used to reverse the diffusion process. Discrete schedules apply abrupt noise transitions, forcing the model to rapidly shift between latent states. In contrast, smooth schedules such as karras or exponential distribute noise reduction evenly, supporting more accurate latent updates.Sampling methods numerically integrate these latent trajectories. Euler-type samplers update the latent state with fixed time step approximations, benefiting from stable transitions when paired with smooth noise decay. Latent Consistency Models (LCM) depend on gradual noise reduction; abrupt schedules can induce over-smoothing and detail loss. Our observations indicate that matching a sampling method’s sensitivity to noise decay with an appropriate denoising schedule is key to preserving image structure while ensuring efficient inference.Flux.1’s behavior indicates that its training regime emphasizes rapid structure formation in early steps. Euler’s robustness across discrete, exponential, and karras schedules suggests that its integration of abrupt noise transitions still aligns well with Flux.1’s latent dynamics. LCM, being more sensitive to the noise decay, only works well with smoother schedules (exponential and karras) that provide gradual latent updates.The failures with AYS and GITS imply that these schedules impose noise trajectories incompatible with Flux.1’s fast-convergence design. Their latent paths likely diverge from the model’s learned reverse diffusion trajectory, causing the state to collapse into uniform or noisy outputs rather than structured images. This sensitivity reinforces that Flux.1 is optimized for few-step denoising with specific noise decay characteristics, and departures from that — especially with schedules that enforce alternative trajectory regularity — can disrupt the image generation process.Flux.1 departs from prior diffusion models by leveraging a T5-style text encoder instead of CLIP, allowing it to process full sentences fluently rather than relying on discrete token hierarchies. Unlike Stable Diffusion, where Booru-style tags and keyword emphasis are required for precision, Flux.1 understands natural language natively, reducing reliance on rigid token structures. Long, descriptive prompts yield better scene coherence, material accuracy, and relational awareness than fragmented keyword lists.Trigger words are optional rather than mandatory, as the model activates concepts contextually rather than requiring explicit token matching. However, structured elements — short modifiers or category cues — can refine specificity without overpowering Flux.1’s broader language comprehension. The model is particularly strong at multi-concept blending, which traditionally caused token interference in CLIP-based architectures. Negative prompting is also more effective, reducing the unintended blending of attributes.Flux.1 performs best with contextual and relational descriptions, leveraging semantic depth over isolated tokens. While Booru tags still function, hybrid prompting — mixing structured elements with full sentences — offers the best balance between control and generative adaptability.LoRA functions differently in Flux.1 compared to Stable Diffusion. Since Flux.1 uses a T5-based encoder, LoRA activation does not require fixed trigger words but instead responds dynamically to natural descriptions. This allows LoRAs to integrate seamlessly into prompts without rigid dependencies.Key parameters such as network dimension, alpha scaling, and captioning density influence performance. Higher network dimension strengthens adaptation but risks overfitting, while alpha scaling balances LoRA integration with the base model. Flux.1’s LoRAs benefit from mixed captioning strategies — varying between short tags and natural descriptions — ensuring activation without over-constraining the generative process. Unlike SDXL, which often requires explicit weight scaling (1.2–1.5x) to activate LoRAs, Flux.1 adapts LoRA strength more organically within context, reducing the need for manual weight adjustments.To maximize LoRA performance in Flux.1, descriptive phrasing should replace rigid token triggers, using context-driven prompts to activate learned modifications naturally. Captions should balance specificity with generalization, ensuring LoRAs enhance rather than dominate the generative output.Optimization Strategies for Low-Resource InferenceQuantization is a pivotal technique in reducing model size and memory usage by lowering the precision of model weights. SDcpp supports various quantization levels, each offering a different balance between memory efficiency and image quality: Reduces memory usage by approximately 75% compared to full precision (FP16) while maintaining good image quality. It introduces a slight computational overhead due to dequantization but is optimal for low-end hardware. Offers slightly better precision than Q4 at the cost of requiring twice the memory. It is suitable for systems with more VRAM where higher image fidelity is desired.For lower-end hardware, Q4_K provides a good balance of speed and quality, while  is better for systems with more VRAM (>16GB).Quantization Impact of Model PartsWe’re loading a model, vae, clip, and t5, and can choose quantized parts for each. The model itself must be quantized due to memory constraints, but the VAE, CLIP, and T5 can remain in higher precision. We tested a q4_K model with safetensors in higher precision, and a fully quantized version where all parts were q4_0.We observed a 2.5x slowdown with the fully quantized run, despite reduced memory usage. Likely due to increased dequantization overhead, precision mismatch-induced stalls, and reduced SIMD efficiency on the Apple M2. While background processes may have contributed to higher involuntary context switches (3.3M vs. 1.48M), they do not fully explain the slowdown. The quantization format (q4_K vs. q4_0) influences computational efficiency rather than raw inference speed, with q4_K employing grouped quantization, which improves data locality and reduces dequantization frequency, while q4_0 likely applies simpler per-tensor quantization, increasing compute overhead. The hybrid approach—quantizing only the diffusion model while keeping VAE, CLIP, and T5 in higher precision—seems to better utilize hardware by avoiding unnecessary precision conversion costs and leveraging FP computation optimizations. These results suggest that full quantization may degrade performance when not optimized for architectural strengths, particularly on FP-optimized hardware like the M2.The sampling method determines the strategy by which noise is removed during the denoising process. Ancestral samplers introduce random variations at each step, leading to more diverse outputs, while fixed-step samplers follow a deterministic trajectory, yielding consistent results.SDcpp integrates several sampling algorithms optimized for different performance criteria: A simple and fast method effective with a lower number of denoising steps, suitable for rapid inference. Prioritizes image quality, requiring more steps and memory. It is ideal for applications where high detail is essential.Latent Consistency Models (LCM): Optimizes speed by drastically reducing the number of required denoising steps (e.g., 4–8 instead of 20–30), making it highly suitable for low-end systems. Users can specify the sampling method using the --sampling-method flag, such as --sampling-method lcm.Memory management is critical in ensuring that diffusion models run efficiently on constrained hardware. SDcpp employs several techniques to optimize memory usage: By processing the VAE decoder in smaller, manageable segments, VAE tiling minimizes peak memory usage. Flash Attention optimizes memory allocation during UNet computations. On CUDA-enabled GPUs, it offers significant memory savings and speed improvements. Flash Attention can be activated via the --diffusion-fa flag.In our experiments on an Apple M2, enabling --vae-tiling reduced memory usage but increased execution time, suggesting a trade-off between efficiency and speed. When --diffusion-fa (Flash Attention) was enabled, execution time did not significantly improve. The combination of both options (vae-tiling and diffusion-fa) resulted in the  but also the , confirming that while these settings help on low-VRAM devices, they introduce performance overhead. The fastest run occurred with both options disabled, though it had the highest memory footprint.Image resolution directly impacts both memory consumption and inference speed. Generating images at a resolution of 1280×640 requires approximately 2.5 times the memory of generating images at 512×512. To accommodate low-resource environments, users can opt for intermediate resolutions such as 768×384 or 1024×512, balancing image quality and computational efficiency.LoRA Delay and Conditioning Graph RecalculationWhen LoRA modules are applied, the conditioning graph must be recalculated due to LoRA’s modification of internal activations, which can reintroduce dependencies on structured tagging if the LoRA was trained on datasets requiring them. The conditioner parses and reweights prompt segments dynamically, adjusting token influence based on LoRA-induced shifts in the embedding space, ensuring compatibility between the altered diffusion model state and the input text. This recalibration process accounts for the delay seen post-LoRA application and before sampling, as the system must harmonize LoRA-induced parameter shifts with Flux.1’s inherently context-aware text encoding.Classifier-Free Guidance ScaleCFG scale (Classifier-Free Guidance Scale) can be set with the --cfg-scale argument. It defaults to 7.0 and controls how strictly the model follows the text prompt, balancing adherence and creativity. Higher values (e.g., 10-15) force the model to generate images that closely match the prompt but can introduce artifacts, while lower values (e.g., 1-5) allow more randomness and artistic interpretation. It impacts performance slightly because higher CFG values increase the weight difference between conditional (prompted) and unconditional (random) predictions, requiring additional computation to balance them. However, the effect on inference speed is minor compared to factors like resolution, model architecture, and sampling steps.Flux.1 seem to have been trained with  as target setting, meaning its internal weighting and contrast are optimized for that value. Lowering CFG to  reduces guidance too much, allowing excessive noise influence, resulting in darker, underexposed images. Raising it to 2.0 strengthens prompt adherence but overemphasizes highlights and contrast, making images appear overly bright. Unlike standard Stable Diffusion, where 7.0 is the default for balanced outputs, Flux.1’s tuning makes , with deviations causing unintended brightness shifts.To analyze the impact of CFG scale on image generation, we generated eight images using CFG 1.0 and 2.0 across the Euler, LCM, iPNDM, and Euler_a samplers with 4 steps and a fixed seed of 42, using the prompt “a beautiful girl in futuristic Tokyo, neon lights,” comparing how different guidance levels influence brightness, contrast, and prompt adherence.Memory-Efficient InferenceRunning Flux.1 (schnell) on an Apple M2 (16GB RAM), we achieve inference without a GPU, completing a 256×256 image in 216.3s with 9.28GB RAM usage. The UNet required just 96.59MB, and VAE decoding used 416MB, demonstrating the efficiency of quantized GGUF models.Our analysis of Stable-Diffusion.cpp and Flux.1 demonstrates that efficient local diffusion inference is feasible even on low-resource hardware, provided that model selection, quantization, and sampling strategies are optimized. Flux.1’s extremely low-step denoising makes it uniquely suited for fast inference, especially when paired with Euler and Euler_a samplers, which balance structure formation and controlled randomness. In contrast, models like LCM introduce excessive smoothing, making them unsuitable for Flux.1’s fast convergence.We also observed that 4 steps yield optimal results with Flux.1, as additional iterations introduce unnecessary alterations rather than improving image fidelity. While our results indicate that full quantization introduces dequantization overhead and computational stalls, external factors such as background system load may have influenced the extent of the observed slowdown. Memory-efficient techniques such as VAE tiling and Flash Attention can reduce hardware requirements but may introduce performance trade-offs. Users should select Q4_K or similar quantization for lower-end hardware, as grouped quantization schemes appear to mitigate some of the performance penalties associated with fully quantized inference.These findings highlight that with the right model architecture, quantization, and sampler choice, high-quality image generation is possible on constrained devices without relying on high-end GPUs. Future improvements may focus on further refining model architectures like Flux.1 and optimizing quantization methods for even faster, memory-efficient inference.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The ups and downs of stratified cross-validation</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpK9pWZGjbE</link><author>probabl</author><category>dev</category><category>ml</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EpK9pWZGjbE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 11:48:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIat2Cdg661wF5DQDWTQAmg">Dev - Probabl</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When you use GridSearchCV in scikit-learn will do a cross-validated hyperparameter search.

Join historians, survivors and experts as they consider one of the great moral dilemmas of the 20th century. Should the Allies have risked killing Auschwitz prisoners and bombed the camp to stop future atrocities?

In April 1944, Jewish prisoners Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler miraculously escaped from Auschwitz concentration camp and fled through Nazi-occupied Poland to find refuge in Žilina, Slovakia, where they connected with the Jewish Underground. Once safe, they recounted what they left behind. Their harrowing testimony revealed the true horror of the Holocaust to the outside world, describing in forensic detail the gas chambers and the full extent of the Nazi extermination program.

While millions of troops fought on both fronts and battled for supremacy in the air during World War II, Nazi forces continued to deport Jews to the concentration camp.  As Vrba and Wetzler’s account made its way to Allies, the idea of bombing the camp was discussed at the highest levels of government. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Allied Air Commanders, the American War Refugee Board and the Jewish Agency were presented with one of the greatest moral questions of the 20th century: Should we bomb Auschwitz and risk killing Jewish prisoners in the camp to stop future atrocities?

German submarine, surface and air attacks were sinking merchant ships by the hundred. If those losses continued, Britain could lose a quarter of its fleet within the year and might just be starved out of the war.  
Yet, just a few years later, everything had changed. By 1943, German U-boats had gone from predator to prey, as the Allies took full control of Atlantic Ocean. So how did they do it? 
The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest campaign of the Second World War, running continuously from the first days, right up until the defeat of Nazi Germany 6 years later. 

In this video, IWM Curator Robert Rumble explores the race to victory in the Atlantic through the lens of war winning technologies, and objects on display at IWM Duxford, and IWM London.

Most legal scholars say the meaning of the 14th Amendment is clear–that people born in the U.S. are citizens, regardless of the citizenship of their parents. But the Trump administration’s legal case is built around the idea that children born to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should be excluded from birthright citizenship.  

WSJ explains how this fight will play out in courts and its broader implications.

  development processes, developed by Beth Andres-Beck and hir father Kent Beck.
  It posits that two communities of software developers have great difficulty
  communicating to each other because they live in very different contexts, so
  advice that applies to one sounds like nonsense to the other.The desert is the common world of software development, where bugs are
  plentiful, skill isn't cultivated, and communications with users is difficult.
  The forest is the world of a well-run team that uses something like Extreme Programming, where developers swiftly put changes into
  production, protected by their tests, code is invested in to keep it healthy,
  and there is regular contact with The Customer.Clearly Beth and Kent prefer The Forest (as do I). But the metaphor is more
  about how description of The Forest and the advice for how to work there often
  sounds nonsensical to those whose only experience is The Desert. It reminds us
  that any lessons we draw about software development practice, or architectural
  patterns, are governed by the context that we experienced them. It is possible
  to change Desert into Forest, but it's difficult - often requiring people to do
  things that are both hard and counter-intuitive. (It seems sadly easier for
  The Forest to submit to desertification.) In this framing I'm definitely a Forest Dweller, and seek with Thoughtworks
  to cultivate a healthy forest for us and our clients. I work to explain The Forest to Desert
  Dwellers, and help my fellow Forest Dwellers to make their forest even more
  plentiful.Kent Beck supplied the image, which he may have painstakingly drew pixel by
    pixel.

1720 was a year of two bubbles and a plague.  The bubbles were the Mississippi Company in France –and the South Sea Bubble in England. In September 1720 - when the bubble burst, England was plunged into an economic and political crisis. This was one of the first examples of a financial boom and bust and was the event that gave rise to the use of the term bubble to describe a spectacular market failure.

This is something Rebellion seemed to figure out around the time of Sniper Elite 3 back in 2014, when the series ditched linear levels set in tight, wartorn streets in favor of a much deeper, wider tour of duty, with each map allowing for player choice in how they navigate the world and complete missions. The series has even gone so far as to create some absurd, Agent 47-like situations in which you can assassinate Nazis. Sniper Elite: Resistance reintroduces that tried-and-true formula for the fourth time in 11 years, and though it's still enjoyable, I can't help but notice how this campaign through the French countryside elicits such a strong sense of deja vu.Sniper Elite is a third-person shooter set during World War II, and like other games in the series, it can be played in first-person when you're aiming. The series has made a name for itself on a deep ballistic physics model that accounts for wind, bullet drop, and positioning, as well as its cherry on top: the X-ray killcam. This feature shows you, in slow-motion, how each bullet shreds Nazis in grotesque detail, inside and out. Like in other Sniper Elite games, a well-placed bullet can shoot their eyes out, explode their hearts, or even obliterate their testicles, among other special displays of sharpshooting.Like its predecessors, the game is a fun and reliable shooter when it comes to sniping mechanics, though I've grown weary of the killcam. These days, I more often skip the killcam, or at least adjust my settings to see fewer headhunting highlight reels. I get it by now; it's neat tech, but they add up over the course of a mission, which already tend to take me about two hours each, because I'm much more interested in stealthily completing my missions than watching the highlight reels of long-range vivisections.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple chips can be hacked to leak secrets from Gmail, iCloud, and more</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/newly-discovered-flaws-in-apple-chips-leak-secrets-in-safari-and-chrome/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Apple-M3-chip-series_screen-1152x648.jpeg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 20:56:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple-designed chips powering Macs, iPhones, and iPads contain two newly discovered vulnerabilities that leak credit card information, locations, and other sensitive data from the Chrome and Safari browsers as they visit sites such as iCloud Calendar, Google Maps, and Proton Mail.The vulnerabilities, affecting the CPUs in later generations of Apple A- and M-series chip sets, open them to side channel attacks, a class of exploit that infers secrets by measuring manifestations such as timing, sound, and power consumption.

Why was there more matter than antimatter left over? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice explore the quantum origins of the universe, charge parity violation, dark matter, and the many quarks that make up our world with CERN particle physicist Harry Cliff. 

We take a look at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and his work in studying b quarks (or “beauty quarks”) and sifting through mountains of data to identify new phenomena. We break down the 17 known fundamental particles—including six quarks, three electron-like particles, and three neutrinos. What particles are yet to be uncovered? Could that be the answer to dark matter?

As we dive into the early universe, we explore how matter and antimatter formed in nearly equal amounts, only for matter to triumph in a cosmic imbalance. What conditions created this asymmetry? We discuss CP violation and the other laws of nature that the universe may have broken to create itself. 

Harry also dives into the lifespan of particles, from the fleeting existence of most, to the surprising stability of protons and electrons. Learn how particle discoveries evolved, from Henri Becquerel’s observation of radioactivity to Karl Anderson’s discovery of antimatter in cosmic rays. We also explore how Einstein’s theory of relativity applies to particle accelerators, where particles moving near light speed experience time differently. Could these machines create a micro black hole? Harry explains why media fears of “destroying the universe” are unfounded and why the cosmos has been conducting such experiments for billions of years.

Finally, we tackle questions about dark matter, its presence in everyday life, and the hypothetical tachyons that could travel faster than light. Through it all, Harry sheds light on the quantum fields underpinning reality, revealing how particles are ripples in these invisible forces. With insights from his books, How to Make an Apple Pie from Scratch and Space Oddities, Harry guides us through the thrilling world of particle physics, showing how much we’ve learned—and how much more there is to discover.

--

As of 2022, humans have deforested 17% of the Amazon, and scientists warn that we may be approaching a tipping point. It’s like removing bricks from a house: take a few and the house remains standing; remove too many and the whole thing will collapse. So, what would happen if the entire Amazon disappeared? Anna Rothschild explores the relationship between this ecosystem and the rest of the planet.

This has prompted comparisons to a famous archeological site where behavior is similarly well preserved: the site of Pompeii, a town crystallized by volcanic eruption almost 2000 years ago.  But when you look into the details, it turns out their residents may have experienced very different final moments.

But in many real-time systems, the server needs to talk first and more often.This is where  and  come into play—two popular methods for achieving real-time updates.In this article, we’ll explore these two techniques, how they work, their pros and cons, and use cases.HTTP, the backbone of the web, follows a :The client (e.g., a browser or mobile app) sends a request to the server.The server processes the request and sends back a response.This model is simple and works for many use-cases, but it has limitations: With plain HTTP, the server cannot proactively push data to the client. The client has to request the data periodically. HTTP is stateless, meaning each request stands alone with no persistent connection to the server. This can be problematic if you need continuous exchange of data.To build truly real-time features—live chat, financial tickers, or gaming updates—you need a mechanism where the server can instantly notify the client when something changes. is a technique that mimics real-time behavior by keeping HTTP requests open until the server has data.Long Polling is an enhancement over traditional polling. In regular polling, the client repeatedly sends requests at fixed intervals (e.g., every second) to check for updates. This can be wasteful if no new data exists. Long Polling tweaks this approach: the client asks the server for data and then “waits” until the server has something new to return or until a timeout occurs.How Does Long Polling Work? to the server, expecting new data.Server holds the request open until it has an update or a timeout is reached.If there's new data, the server immediately responds.If there’s no new data and the timeout is reached, the server responds with an empty or minimal message.Once the client receives a response—new data or a timeout—it immediately sends a new request to the server to keep the connection loop going.Simple to implement (uses standard HTTP).Supported universally since it uses standard HTTP, and it works reliably through firewalls and proxies.Higher latency after each update (client must re-establish connection).Resource-heavy on servers (many open hanging requests).Simple chat or comment systems where real-time but slightly delayed updates (near real-time) are acceptable.Notification systems for less frequent updates (e.g., Gmail’s "new email" alert).Legacy systems where WebSockets aren’t feasible.Code Example (JavaScript) provide a full-duplex, persistent connection between the client and the server.Once established, both parties can send data to each other at any time, without the overhead of repeated HTTP requests. Client sends an HTTP request with .: If supported, the server upgrades the connection to WebSocket (switching from  to ). After the handshake, client and server keep a TCP socket open for communication.Full-Duplex Communication: Once upgraded, data can be exchanged bidirectionally in real time until either side closes the connection.Ultra-low latency (no repeated handshakes).Lower overhead since there’s only one persistent connection rather than repeated HTTP requests.Scalable for real-time applications that need to support large number of concurrent users.More complex setup (requires the client and server to support WebSocket).Some proxies and firewalls may not allow WebSocket traffic.Complexity in implementation and handling reconnections/errors.Server resource usage might grow if you have a large number of concurrent connections.Live chat and collaboration tools (Slack, Google Docs, etc.).Multiplayer online games with real-time state synchronization.Live sports/financial dashboards that need to push frequent updates.Code Example (JavaScript)Both methods achieve real-time updates, but your choice depends on your project’s requirements: is easier to implement using standard libraries. Any environment that supports HTTP can handle it, often without extra packages. require a bit more setup and a capable proxy environment (e.g., support in Nginx or HAProxy). However, many frameworks (e.g., Socket.io) simplify the process significantly.Scalability and Performance can become resource-intensive with a large number of simultaneous clients, due to multiple open connections waiting on the server side. offer a more efficient, persistent connection and scale better for heavy, frequent data streams. fits scenarios where data updates aren’t super frequent. If new data arrives every few seconds or minutes, long polling might be enough. are better for high-frequency updates or two-way communication (e.g., multiple participants editing a document or interacting in a game). typically works even in older networks or those with strict firewalls. might face issues in certain corporate or older mobile environments, though this is less of a problem as the standard becomes more widespread.While both achieve real-time communication, WebSockets are generally more efficient for truly real-time applications, while Long Polling can be simpler to implement for less demanding scenarios.1. Server-Sent Events (SSE)Allows the server to push messages to the client over HTTP.It's simpler than WebSockets for one-way communication, but not full-duplex.Best suited for use cases like news feeds, real-time notifications, and status updates.Commonly used in IoT for lightweight publish-subscribe messaging.Specialized for device-to-device or device-to-server communication with minimal overhead.3. Libraries like Socket.ioProvides an abstraction over WebSockets for easier real-time communication.Automatically falls back to long polling if WebSockets are unsupported.Ensures cross-browser compatibility with robust and reliable performance.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

The project, intended to replace a 20-year-old SAP system with a SaaS-based HR and finance system, has faced multiple setbacks, renegotiated contracts, and a new systems integrator, with completion now pushed to December 2025. The Register reports: West Sussex County Council is taking advantage of the so-called "flexible use of capital receipts scheme" introduced in 2016 by the UK government to allow councils to use money from the sale of assets such as land, offices, and housing to fund projects that result in ongoing revenue savings. An example of the asset disposals that might contribute to the project -- set to see the council move off a 20-year-old SAP system -- comes from the sale of a former fire station in Horley, advertised for $3.1 million.
 
Meanwhile, the delays to the project, which began in November 2019, forced the council to renegotiate its terms with Oracle, at a cost of $3 million. The council had expected the new SaaS-based HR and finance system to go live in 2021, and signed a five-year license agreement until June 2025. The plans to go live were put back to 2023, and in the spring of 2024 delayed again until December 2025. According to council documents published this week [PDF], it has "approved the variation of the contract with Oracle Corporation UK Limited" to cover the period from June 2025 to June 2028 and an option to extend again to the period June 2028 to 2030. "The total value of the proposed variation is $2.96 million if the full term of the extension periods are taken," the council said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Facebook Flags Linux Topics As &apos;Cybersecurity Threats&apos;</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/27/2120230/facebook-flags-linux-topics-as-cybersecurity-threats?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Facebook has banned posts mentioning Linux-related topics, with the popular Linux news and discussion site, DistroWatch, at the center of the controversy. Tom's Hardware reports: A post on the site claims, "Facebook's internal policy makers decided that Linux is malware and labeled groups associated with Linux as being 'cybersecurity threats.' We tried to post some blurb about distrowatch.com on Facebook and can confirm that it was barred with a message citing Community Standards. DistroWatch says that the Facebook ban took effect on January 19. Readers have reported difficulty posting links to the site on this social media platform. Moreover, some have told DistroWatch that their Facebook accounts have been locked or limited after sharing posts mentioning Linux topics.
 
If you're wondering if there might be something specific to DistroWatch.com, something on the site that the owners/operators perhaps don't even know about, for example, then it seems pretty safe to rule out such a possibility. Reports show that "multiple groups associated with Linux and Linux discussions have either been shut down or had many of their posts removed." However, we tested a few other Facebook posts with mentions of Linux, and they didn't get blocked immediately. Copenhagen-hosted DistroWatch says it has tried to appeal against the Community Standards-triggered ban. However, they say that a Facebook representative said that Linux topics would remain on the cybersecurity filter. The DistroWatch writer subsequently got their Facebook account locked... DistroWatch points out the irony at play here: "Facebook runs much of its infrastructure on Linux and often posts job ads looking for Linux developers."

It was an integral part of the Nazi regime's rapid dismantling of German democracy. Within weeks, the first concentration camp, Dachau, was opened to imprison political opponents, marking the start of a vast and brutal system of camps across Germany and later in the occupied territories. The camps began as places to imprison political enemies and people the Nazis deemed to be “undesirables”. But, as the Second World War progressed, these camps became centres of industrial-scale genocide, with Auschwitz becoming perhaps the most infamous. In this episode, Dan is joined by Nikolaus Wachsmann, Professor of Modern European History at Birkbeck University of London. They discuss the historical context and horrors of Auschwitz, marking Holocaust Memorial Day on the 80th anniversary of its liberation by the Red Army.Warning: This episode contains a detailed discussion of the Holocaust and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Marc Andreessen: Trump, Power, Tech, AI, Immigration &amp; Future of America | Lex Fridman Podcast #458</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OHWnPOKh_S0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 20:47:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Marc Andreessen is an entrepreneur, investor, co-creator of Mosaic, co-founder of Netscape, and co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

By the early 20th century, Imperial Japan had established itself as the dominant force in Asia. Through ruthless military conquests, the small island nation greatly expanded its borders. The rising imperial power soon set its sights on conquering much of East Asia. By 1921, nearly a third of Japan’s national budget was dedicated to building one of the most powerful navies in the world.

In response to Japan and other world powers rapidly expanding their naval strength, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in 1922 to impose restrictions on the size and number of warships. However, American military planners were not convinced—rightfully so—that Imperial Japan would adhere to these new restrictions for very long. The United States, surrounded by two enormous oceans, seemed increasingly vulnerable. 

In War Plan Orange (first outlined in 1919 and revised in subsequent years), military planners devised strategies for a possible war with Imperial Japan. Particular attention was given to key targets like the United States' West Coast, Pearl Harbor, and the vital Suez Canal. With millions of square kilometers of open Pacific Ocean, it was possible for the Imperial Japanese Navy to go undetected for weeks before launching a surprise attack. Scout cruisers were the U.S. Navy’s primary means of searching for enemy fleets, but they were too slow, too few in number, and too costly to adequately cover the vast Pacific. Aircraft of the era also lacked the range to scout large sections of the ocean. In response, Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the U.S. Bureau of Aeronautics, advocated for a radical alternative.

Under Moffett's direction, the United States began experimenting with rigid airships in 1923. Airships appeared to be the ideal solution for enhancing the Navy’s long-range scouting capabilities. As "scout cruisers of the air," airships combined the extended range of surface vessels with speeds nearly as fast as aircraft. The Navy’s first two rigid airships, the USS Shenandoah (ZR-1) and USS Los Angeles (ZR-3), helped pioneer the operational intricacies of airship use in a military setting. Navy crews trained for long-range day missions and practiced mooring to ships at sea to replenish fuel and helium. The Navy also perfected the practice of carrying, launching, and recovering aircraft in mid-flight, which was considered vital for airship defense.

In 1929, construction began on two of the largest airships the world had ever seen: the USS Akron (ZRS-4) and the USS Macon (ZRS-5). Defended by machine guns and equipped with internal hangars capable of carrying five Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters, these airships were scouting warships in every sense. If they proved successful, there were plans to build at least a dozen more to help patrol the vast Pacific Ocean and keep America safe.

"This bill aligns Michigan with a majority of the country," according to the state's announcement, which says the bill "advances technological literacy" and ensures their students "are well-equipped with the critical thinking skills necessary for success in the workforce." 
Slashdot reader theodp writes:



From the Michigan House Fiscal Agency Analysis: "Supporters of the bill say that increasing access to computer science courses for students in schools should be a priority of the state in order to ensure that students can compete for the types of jobs that have good pay and will be needed in the coming decades." 
That analysis goes on to report that testifying in favor of the bill were tech-giant backed nonprofit Code.org (Microsoft is a $30 million Code.org donor), Amazon and AWS (Amazon is a $30+ million Code.org donor), the tech-supported Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), and the lobbying organization TechNet, whose members include Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and OpenAI). 
It's not clear how many high schools in Michigan are already teaching CS courses, but this still raises a popular question for discussion.

Wikipedia defines ACPI as "an open standard that operating systems can use to discover and configure computer hardware components" for things like power management and putting unused hardware components to sleep. Phoronix reports:

The ACPI change worth highlighting for Linux 6.14 is switching from msleep() to usleep_range() within the acpi_os_sleep() call in the kernel. This reduces spurious sleep time due to timer inaccuracy. Linux ACPI/PM maintainer Rafael Wysocki of Intel who authored this change noted that it could "spectacularly" reduce the duration of system suspend and resume transitions on some systems... 

Rafael explained in the patch making the sleep change: 

 "The extra delay added by msleep() to the sleep time value passed to it can be significant, roughly between 1.5 ns on systems with HZ = 1000 and as much as 15 ms on systems with HZ = 100, which is hardly acceptable, at least for small sleep time values." 
One 2022 bug report complained a Dell XPS 13 using Thunderbolt took "a full 8 seconds to suspend and a full 8 seconds to resume even though no physical devices are connected." In November an Intel engineer posted on the kernel mailing list that the fix gave a Dell XPS 13 a 42% improvement in kernel resume time (from 1943ms to 1127ms).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Does Ice Float?

But "Bertie" proved otherwise!

From scandalous affairs—one of which may have contributed to his father’s death—to a duel with Winston Churchill's father, Edward VII lived a life full of intrigue and controversy. This video dives into the debauchery, drama, and larger-than-life escapades of the man who would become king.

"[P]otential investors who are engaged in the talks include Microsoft."

Under the deal now being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner ByteDance would retain a minority stake in the company, but the app's algorithm, data collection and software updates will be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's web infrastructure... "The goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok," said the person directly involved in the talks, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deliberations. "ByteDance wouldn't completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership...." Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, according to the source involved in the discussions, who said Oracle is interested in a TikTok stake "in the tens of billions," but the rest of the deal is in flux... 


Under a law passed by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court, TikTok must execute what is known as "qualified divestiture" from ByteDance in order to stay in business in the U.S... A congressional staffer involved in talks about TikTok's future, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said binding legal agreements from the White House ensuring ByteDance cannot covertly manipulate the app will prove critical in winning lawmakers' approval. "A key part is showing there is no operational relationship with ByteDance, that they do not have control," the Congressional staffer said. "There needs to be no backdoors where China can potentially gain access...." 


Chinese regulators, who have for years opposed the selling of TikTok, recently signaled that they would not stand in the way of a TikTok ownership change, saying acquisitions "should be independently decided by the enterprises and based on market principles." The statement, at first, does not seem to say much, but negotiators in the White House believe it indicates that Beijing is not planning to block a deal that gives American investors a majority-stake position in the company.
 

"Meanwhile, Apple and Google still have not returned TikTok to app stores..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chopin&apos;s Military Hallucinations with Karina Tseng and Anthony Ratinov</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diDnVUPRaYI</link><author>Ben Laude</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/diDnVUPRaYI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 02:19:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSFlVqRyNfIJDsmpkcY57w">Ben Laude</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch Karina & Anthony's full Polonaise performances:

What’s Going on in the Containerd Neighborhood? - Phil Estes, AWS; Samuel Karp, Google; Akihiro Suda, NTT; Michael Brown, IBM; Kirtana Ashok, Microsoft

Our recent maintainer sessions have covered the soon-to-launch containerd v2.0. During this session led by maintainers we will give a brief update on 2.0, but will spend more time looking at the ecosystem around us. Why does containerd exist? What value does it bring to the overall cloud native world? How are other projects using it to build and extend containerd in useful ways? We’ll spend some time on containerd’s largest subproject, nerdctl, which also has an upcoming 2.0 release, and additionally catch the community up on activity in our Rust subproject ecosystem, the runwasi containerd shim, and lazy loading snapshotters. Since this is KubeCon, we’ll also provide an update on CRI changes and KEP-driven additions around NRI, DRA, and checkpoint/restore. Attendees will leave with a broad view of the larger containerd ecosystem of projects as well as key information on how to get involved if you are interested to help and contribute in any way to the “containerd neighborhood!”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Welcome &amp; Introduction: A Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the CNCF Landscape- Katherine Druckman, Lori Lorusso</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTCAOa0-VdU</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hTCAOa0-VdU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 23:37:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

It's the code that processes packets of network traffic, and Linux "is the most widely used OS for data center servers," according to the article:

The team tested their solution's effectiveness and submitted it to Linux for consideration, and the code was published this month as part of Linux's newest kernel, release version 6.13. "All these big companies — Amazon, Google, Meta — use Linux in some capacity, but they're very picky about how they decide to use it," said Martin Karsten [professor of Computer Science in the Waterloo's Math Faculty]. "If they choose to 'switch on' our method in their data centers, it could save gigawatt hours of energy worldwide. Almost every single service request that happens on the Internet could be positively affected by this." 

The University of Waterloo is building a green computer server room as part of its new mathematics building, and Karsten believes sustainability research must be a priority for computer scientists. "We all have a part to play in building a greener future," he said. The Linux Foundation, which oversees the development of the Linux OS, is a founder member of the Green Software Foundation, an organization set up to look at ways of developing "green software" — code that reduces energy consumption. 

Karsten "teamed up with Joe Damato, distinguished engineer at Fastly" to develop the 30 lines of code, according to an announcement from the university. "The Linux kernel code addition developed by Karsten and Damato was based on research published in ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review" (by Karsten and grad student Peter Cai). 

Their paper "reviews the performance characteristics of network stack processing for communication-heavy server applications," devising an "indirect methodology" to "identify and quantify the direct and indirect costs of asynchronous hardware interrupt requests (IRQ) as a major source of overhead... 

"Based on these findings, a small modification of a vanilla Linux system is devised that improves the efficiency and performance of traditional kernel-based networking significantly, resulting in up to 45% increased throughput..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JRE MMA Show #165 with Jiri Prochazka</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lpfgsPUMCaM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 18:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Joe sits down with Jiří Procházka, a professional mixed martial artist currently competing in the Light Heavyweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

Rita Dove learns about her great-grandfather's criminal charges and trying adulthood. He was acquitted on an assault charge, but later in life, after a name change, was charged with operating a speakeasy during Prohibition.

Poet and essayist Rita Dove was awarded the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for her third poetry book, "Thomas and Beulah". She received the 1996 National Humanities Medal from President Clinton and the 2011 National Medal of Arts from President Obama – the only poet honored with both White House recognitions. From 1993 to 1995 she served as U.S. Poet Laureate. Born in 1952 in Akron, Ohio, Dove has authored ten volumes of poetry and received 29 honorary doctorates among numerous other accolades.

Collective Memory for AI on Decentralized Knowledge Graph // MLOps Podcast #285 with Tomaz Levak, Founder of Trace Labs, Core Developers of OriginTrail.

// Abstract
The talk focuses on how OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph serves as a collective memory for AI and enables neuro-symbolic AI. We cover the basics of OriginTrail’s symbolic AI fundamentals (i.e. knowledge graphs) and go over details how decentralization improves data integrity, provenance, and user control. We’ll cover the DKG role in AI agentic frameworks and how it helps with verifying and accessing diverse data sources, while maintaining compatibility with existing standards. 

We’ll explore practical use cases from the enterprise sector as well as latest integrations into frameworks like ElizaOS. We conclude by outlining the future potential of decentralized AI, AI becoming the interface to “eat” SaaS and the general convergence of AI, Internet and Crypto.

"Our aim here isn't just to launch a bunch of different stores in different places, but to build a single, cross-platform store in which, within the era of multi-platform games, if you buy a game or digital items in one place, you have the ability to own them everywhere," Epic CEO Tim Sweeney told reporters during a press briefing. The Verge reports: Under the program, Epic will offer new free games in the store each month before eventually switching to a weekly schedule. However, the games aren't actually in the store yet -- Epic said on Thursday that it "ran into a few bugs that we're working through now" and "we'll provide an update once the games are live and ready to play!"
 
To sweeten the deal for developers that participate in the free games program on iOS, Epic will help defray the cost of using third-party marketplaces. For one year, it will pay these developers' Core Technology Fee (CTF): a 50 euro cent fee levied on every install of an iOS app that uses third-party stores after it exceeds 1 million annual downloads. (Apple gives developers with less than 10 million euros in global revenue a three-year on-ramp.) [...] Epic writes in its blog post that covering the fee "is not financially viable for every third party app store or for Epic long term, but we'll do it while the European Commission investigates Apple's non-compliance with the law."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Panama Canal</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-panama-canal</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/679116867e5a4982476a84b0/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=awug-Mo6-Ic-lR51OOIDX5aFz_rgMofpwEwQhaVnSlM" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What is the history of the Panama Canal and why does Trump think he can 'take it back'? Dan is joined by Professor Julie Greene to delve into the long backstory of this 50-mile waterway that changed the world. Its journey from concept to completion was fraught as many nations sought to build it over several centuries, with the US eventually taking up the costly task in the 1900s. During the decade-long construction, many workers, mostly from the Caribbean, suffered awful working conditions and were injured or died building it. Total control was handed over to Panama in the 1990s.Better understand the headlines with this deep dive into history.You can learn more in Julie's books 'Archival Secrets, Caribbean Workers, and the Panama Canal' and 'The Canal Builders.'Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Max Carrey]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.14 Adds Support For The Microsoft Copilot Key Found On New Laptops</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/23/2333254/linux-614-adds-support-for-the-microsoft-copilot-key-found-on-new-laptops?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Linux 6.14 kernel now maps out support for Microsoft's "Copilot" key "so that user-space software can determine the behavior for handling that key's action on the Linux desktop," writes Phoronix's Michael Larabel.

One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what’s known in the business as a “magic packet.” On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network’s Junos OS has been doing just that.J-Magic, the tracking name for the backdoor, goes one step further to prevent unauthorized access. After receiving a magic packet hidden in the normal flow of TCP traffic, it relays a challenge to the device that sent it. The challenge comes in the form of a string of text that’s encrypted using the public portion of an RSA key. The initiating party must then respond with the corresponding plaintext, proving it has access to the secret key.The lightweight backdoor is also notable because it resided only in memory, a trait that makes detection harder for defenders. The combination prompted researchers at Lumen Technology’s Black Lotus Lab to sit up and take notice.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why So Many Ancient Civilizations Collapsed At The Same Time</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l8YQuyjWks</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1l8YQuyjWks?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Bronze Age collapse is perhaps one of the greatest disasters in human history and also one of the least understood.

--

Moore’s Law states that every 1 to 2 years the number of transistors that can fit on a given size computer chip will double. Thanks to this law, chips have gotten smaller, faster, more efficient, and cheaper. But today, there are four key problems that trip up this trend, potentially ending Moore’s Law and fundamentally changing how computing progresses. Sajan Saini and George Zaidan investigate.

The schools serve 60 million students and employ an unknown number of teachers. Besides providing software for administration, grades, and other functions, PowerSchool stores personal data for students and teachers, with much of that data including Social Security numbers, medical information, and home addresses.On January 7, PowerSchool revealed that it had experienced a network intrusion two weeks earlier that resulted in the “unauthorized exportation of personal information” customers stored in PowerSchool’s Student Information System (SIS) through PowerSource, a customer support portal. Information stolen included individuals’ names, contact information, dates of birth, medical alert information, Social Security Numbers, and unspecified “other related information.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Researchers say new attack could take down the European power grid</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/could-hackers-use-new-attack-to-take-down-european-power-grid/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/euripean-ripple-attack-flipper-zero-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 12:00:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Late last month, researchers revealed a finding that’s likely to shock some people and confirm the low expectations of others: Renewable energy facilities throughout Central Europe use unencrypted radio signals to receive commands to feed or ditch power into or from the grid that serves some 450 million people throughout the continent.Fabian Bräunlein and Luca Melette stumbled on their discovery largely by accident while working on what they thought would be a much different sort of hacking project. After observing a radio receiver on the streetlight poles throughout Berlin, they got to wondering: Would it be possible for someone with a central transmitter to control them en masse, and if so, could they create a city-wide light installation along the lines of Project Blinkenlights?

HTTP Methods (Verbs) in REST APIsHTTP provides a set of  that define the type of operation to be performed on a resource.In RESTful architectures, these methods typically map to CRUD operations:It’s essential to use the correct HTTP method to make your API clear and intuitive. For example,  signals a read-only request to developers and should never modify server data, while  indicates data creation or an action that results in a change.2. REST is Resource-OrientedIn RESTful API design, data is represented as , and each resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).→ A collection (or list) of books → A specific book with ID 123An  is a combination of:An HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT etc.)A resource URI (, )Each endpoint represents a specific operation on a resource. → Fetch all books → Create a new book → Delete the book with ID 123Using clear and consistent endpoints helps developers quickly understand how to interact with your API.4. HTTP Status Codes: Understanding API ResponsesEach API response includes an , which indicates the result of the request.Using meaningful status codes is important for helping consumers of your API understand why a request might have failed and how they can fix or retry it.Common status codes include:: The request was successfully received and processed.: The request succeeded.: A new resource was successfully created.: The request succeeded, but there is no content to return.: Further action is needed to complete the request (e.g., a different endpoint or resource location).: There was an error in the request sent by the client.: The request was malformed or invalid.: Authentication is required or has failed.: The client does not have permission to access the resource.: The requested resource does not exist.: Rate limit exceeded.: The server encountered an error while processing the request.500 Internal Server Error: A general error occurred on the server.: The server is currently unable to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload.1. Define Clear Resource Naming ConventionsUsing a consistent, intuitive, and hierarchical structure for API endpoints improves both readability and usability. The goal is to help developers quickly understand how to interact with your API without extensive documentation.Since REST is resource-oriented, focus on  (nouns) rather than  (verbs) for your endpoints. The HTTP methods (, , etc.) already describe the action, so using verbs in the URL are redundant.GET /getAllUsers
POST /createNewOrder
DELETE /removeProduct/123GET /users
POST /orders
DELETE /products/123]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Steve Pagliuca Brought Bain’s Playbook to the Celtics | The Deal</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyoWePXT50g</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/NyoWePXT50g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 23:00:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of The Deal, Alex Rodriguez and Jason Kelly sit with Steve Pagliuca to discuss his ownership principles for the Boston Celtics and Atalanta Bergamasca Calcio.

It had a relatively low velocity gun, it was rumoured to burst into flames at a moments notice and was seen to be inferior to German heavy tanks. But is the Sherman's notoriety deserved?

In this video, IWM's John Delaney will examine the M4 Sherman in the round. He'll look at the tank's design, what it was produced to do, and how it compared to its German equivalents. Plus he'll examine some of the Sherman's forgotten attributes which outclassed even the heaviest German tanks.

As a result we'll gain a more nuanced view and a better appreciation of just how effective the Sherman was in the Second World War.

Here are some of them:The risk of error increases if a single authority decides the moderation policies.There’s a risk of bias when a single authority makes moderation decisions.Managing moderation at scale needs a lot of effort; it becomes a bottleneck.So they set up Bluesky: a research initiative to build a decentralized social network.A decentralized architecture distributes control across many servers.Here are 3 popular decentralized architectures in distributed systems:Federated architecture: client-server model; but different people run parts of the system and parts communicate with each other.Peer-to-Peer architecture: there’s no difference between client and server; each device acts as both.Blockchain architecture: distributed ledger for consensus and trustless interactions between servers.Bluesky uses a federated architecturefor its familiar client-server model, reliability, and convenience. So each server could be run by different people and servers communicate with each other over HTTP.Think of the federated network as email; a person with Gmail can communicate with someone using Protonmail.Yet building a decentralized social network at scale is difficult.So smart engineers at Bluesky used simple ideas to solve this hard problem.I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):They created a decentralized open-source framework to build social networking apps, called Authenticated Transfer Protocol (), and built Bluesky on top of it.Put simply, Bluesky doesn’t run separate servers; instead, ATProto servers distribute messages to each other.A user’s data is shared across apps built on ATProto; Bluesky is one of the apps. So if a user switches between apps on ATProto, such as a photo-sharing app or blogging app, they don’t lose their followers (social graph).Imagine ATProto as Disneyland Park and Bluesky as one of its attractions. A single ticket is enough to visit all the attractions in the park. And if you don’t like one of the attractions, try another one in the park.Here’s how Bluesky works:A post is a short status update by a user; it includes text and images. The text content and timestamp of the post are stored in a . Think of the repository as a collection of data published by a single user.SQLite is used as its data layer for simplicity; each repository gets a separate SQLite database.The data records are encoded in CBOR, a compact binary format, before storing it in SQLite for low costs.Repositories of different users are stored on a ; they set up many data servers for scale.A data server exposes HTTP to handle client requests. Put simply, the data server acts as a proxy for all client interactions. Also it manages user authentication and authorization. The data server includes tooling to automatically apply updates in the federated architecture.They run 6 million user repositories on a single data server at 150 USD per month.Think of the user repository as a Git repo and the data server as GitHub. It’s easy to move a Git repo from GitHub to GitLab. Similarly, a user repository is movable from one data server to another.Besides it’s possible to use alternative clients for Bluesky. Yet it’s necessary to maintain a standard data schema for interactions. So separate  and API endpoints are defined for each app on ATProto, including Bluesky.A user's repository doesn’t store information about actions performed by their followers such as comments or likes on their post. Instead, it’s stored only in the repository of the follower who took the action.A post is shown to the user’s followers.Yet it’s expensive to push updates to each follower’s repository. So information is collected from every data server using the .The crawler doesn’t index data but forwards it.The crawler subscribes for updates on the data server: new posts, likes, or comments.The data server notifies the crawler about updates in real time over websockets.The crawler collects information from data servers and generates a .Consider the generated stream as a log over websockets; put simply, the crawler combines each user’s actions into a single TCP connection.A user's post is shown to followers only after counting the likes, comments, and reposts on it.Yet the stream doesn’t contain this information. So the stream’s data is aggregated using the ; it transforms raw data into a consumable form by processing it. Imagine the index server as a data presentation layer.The index server is built using the Go language for concurrency. A NoSQL database, ScyllaDB, is used as its data layer for horizontal scalability.A reference to the user's post ID is added to the follower’s repository when they like or repost a post. So the total number of likes and reposts is calculated by crawling every user repository and adding the numbers.Here’s the workflow for displaying a post:A user’s request is routed via their data server to the index server.The data server finds the people a user follows by looking at their repository.The index server creates a list of post IDs in reverse chronological order.The index server expands the list of post IDs to full posts with content.The index server then responds to the client.In short, a user repository stores primary data, while the index server stores derived data from repositories.The index server is the most read-heavy service; so, its results are cached using Redis, an in-memory storage, for performance.JSON Web Token () is used for authentication between Bluesky services.Media files, such as images and videos, are stored on the data server’s disk for simplicity. A cryptographic ID () is used to reference the media files in the repository. The index server fetches the media files from the data server on user request and caches them on the content delivery network () for efficiency.A user updates only their repository when they follow someone. Their repository adds a reference to the user’s unique decentralized identifier () to indicate follow.The number of followers for a user is found by indexing every repository. This is similar to how Google finds inbound links to a web page; all documents on the web are crawled.A user account includes a handle based on the domain name (); it keeps things simple.And each user automatically gets a handle from the ‘bsky.social’ subdomain upon account creation. Yet posts are stored using DID, and the user handle is displayed along with the posts. So changes to a user's handle don’t affect their previous posts.A user’s DID is immutable, but the handle is mutable; put simply, a user’s handle is reassignable to a custom domain name.Here’s how a user handle with a custom domain name is verified on Bluesky:The user enters their custom domain name in the Bluesky account settings.Bluesky generates a unique text value for the user: public key.The user stores this value in the DNS TXT record of the custom domain name.The index server then periodically checks the DNS TXT record and validates the user handle. Imagine  as a text data field for domain name settings.3. User Timeline and FeedA user’s timeline is created by arranging their posts in reverse chronological order.Yet a user’s repository doesn’t contain information about likes and comments received on a post. So the request is sent to the index server; it returns the user’s timeline with aggregated data.A feed is created from posts by people a user follows.Bluesky supports feeds with custom logic, and there are 50K+ custom feeds available. Consider the  as a filter for a specific list of keywords or users.The crawler generates a stream from data servers.The feed generator filters, sorts, and ranks the content based on custom logic.The feed generator creates a list of post IDs.The index server then populates the feed’s content on a user request. is used to fetch the feed; it offers better performance. It includes an extra parameter in API requests and responses. The cursor parameter points to a specific item in the dataset; for example, the post’s timestamp to fetch feed until a specific post.A sequential unique column, such as the post's timestamp, is chosen for pagination.The user requests include the cursor parameter to indicate the result’s offset.The index server uses the cursor parameter to paginate the result dataset.The index server responds with the cursor parameter for future requests.The client decides the cursor parameter’s window size based on its viewport. The cursor-based pagination scales well as it prevents a full table scan in the index server.Imagine a  as metadata to categorize content. Besides it’s possible to apply a label manually. A user chooses to hide or show a warning for posts with a specific label.This preference is stored on their data server.Here’s how Bluesky moderation works:The moderation service consumes the stream from the crawler.The moderation service analyzes the content and assigns a label to it.The index server stores the content along with its label.The user requests are routed via the data server to the index server.The data server includes label IDs in HTTP request headers before forwarding them.The index server applies the label setting in the response.Also a data server operator does basic moderation. The data server filters out the muted users before responding to the client.Put simply, a user can post about anything, but the content is moderated before being shown to the public.Bluesky allows a user to see how many people they follow also follow a specific user: social proof.For example, when I visit Jay’s Bluesky profile, it shows how many people I follow also follow her.Let’s dive into the different approaches they used to build this feature.Find the people I follow by querying the database.Do separate parallel queries for each user to find the people they follow.Check if any of them also follow Jay.But this approach won’t scale as the number of parallel queries increases with the number of people a user follows.A scalable approach is to convert it into a set intersection problem:Set 1 tracks the people I follow.Set 2 tracks the people who follow Jay.The intersection of these sets gives the expected result.An in-memory graph service prevents expensive database queries and performs intersections quickly. Yet Redis Sets don’t use different CPU cores at once. So here’s how they implemented a minimum viable product:Each user has a 32-character DID.The DID values are converted into uint64 to reduce memory usage.Each user’s DID maintains 2 sets: people they follow and people who follow them.But it still consumes a lot of memory and takes extra time to start.So they optimized the graph service by implementing it using Roaring Bitmaps.Yet let’s take a step back and learn Bitmaps to better understand Roaring Bitmaps.A  represents binary states using bit arrays.Imagine Bluesky has only 100 users.The index value of the people I follow is set to 1 on the Bitmap; the people I follow are then found by walking the Bitmap and recording the index of non-zero bits. A constant time lookup tells whether I follow a specific user. Although Bitmaps do faster bitwise operations, it’s inefficient for sparse data. A 100-bit long Bitmap is needed even if I follow only a single user; so, it won’t scale for Bluesky’s needs.It turns consecutive 0s and 1s into a number for reduced storage. For example, if I follow the last 10 users, only the last 10 indices are marked by 1. With Run-Length Encoding, it’s stored as 90 0s and 10 1s, thus low storage costs.But this approach won’t scale for randomly populated data, and a lookup walks the entire Bitset to find an index.Ready for the best technique? .Think of it as compressed Bitmaps, but 100 times faster. A Roaring Bitmap splits data into containers and each container uses a different storage mechanism.The dense data is stored in a container using Bitmap; it uses a fixed-size bit array.The data with a large contiguous range of integers are stored in a container using run-length encoding; which reduces storage costs.The sparse data is stored in a container as integers in a sorted array; it reduces storage needs.Put simply, Roaring Bitmaps use different containers based on data sparsity.The set intersection is done in parallel and a container is converted into a different format for the set intersection. Also the graph data is stored and transferred over the network in Roaring Bitmap’s serialization format.Many instances of graph service are run for high availability and rolling updates.Bluesky supports short videos up to 90 seconds long.The video is streamed through HTTP Live Streaming (). Think of HLS as a group of text files; it’s a standard for adaptive bitrate video streaming.A client dynamically changes video quality based on network conditions.A video is encoded into different quality levels: 480p, 720p, 1080p, and so on.Each encoded video is split into small segments of 5 seconds long.The client checks the network conditions and requests video segments of the right quality.HLS uses Playlist files to manage encoded video segments. Imagine the  as a text file, and there are 2 types of Playlists:Master playlist: list of all video quality levels available.Media playlist: list of all video segments for a specific video quality.First, the client downloads the Master playlist to find available quality levels. Second, it selects a Media playlist based on network conditions. Third, it downloads the video segments in the sequence defined on the Media playlist.The videos and playlists are cached in CDN to reduce costs and handle bandwidth needs. The stream requests are routed to CDN via 302 HTTP redirects.The video views are tracked by counting requests to its Master playlist file.And the response for the Master playlist includes a Session ID; it’s included in future requests for Media playlists to track the user session.Besides the video seconds watched by a user are found by checking the last fetched video segment.A video subtitle is stored in text format and has a separate Media playlist file.The Master playlist includes a reference to subtitles; here’s how it works:The client finds the available subtitles by querying the Master playlist.The client downloads a specific subtitle's Media playlist based on the language selected by the user.The client then downloads the subtitle segments defined in the Media Playlist.Subscribe to get simplified system design case studies delivered to your inbox:Bluesky Quality AttributesA user’s data is cryptographically signed before saving it in the data server; it shows data authorship.The Merkle search tree is used to check the integrity of data, such as posts, transferred over the network.Think of the  as an efficient data structure to check data integrity. It doesn’t store original data; instead, it has only cryptographic hashes representing data.Besides the crawler keeps a copy of each user’s repository; it verifies the Merkle search tree signatures on data updates.The crawler generates a stream to update the index server.Yet the stream increases bandwidth and infrastructure costs. So the events are validated on the crawler and services, such as the feed generator, are connected to a trusted crawler. Besides Merkle search tree blocks are converted to JSON objects, which lack verifiability and signatures, to reduce stream size.Put simply, Merkle search tree verification overhead is avoided by consuming the stream from a trustable crawler.The crawler transfers the stream to the index server over websockets; zstd compresses websocket traffic for performance.A user, with a massive following, needs a data server with only tiny computing resources as the index server displays aggregated data.Every change to a user's profile is propagated via the index server; which, means eventual consistency.Yet a user viewing their profile right after an update should see the latest changes. So Bluesky offers read-after-write consistency for profile updates; here’s how:All client requests are routed via the data server to the index server.The response headers from the index server are compared against the data server. The response is updated to include missing records before returning it to the client.This read-after-write behavior applies only to a user viewing their profile; others see the changes eventually.A popular user's post notifies many users, which results in many requests to view the post at once.The results from the index server are cached to reduce the database load. Yet a popular user's post creates a thundering herd problem.A view request, the first one, from a follower reaches the cache server.The cache server queries the database for post content.Requests from others reach the database while the cache waits for the first response.It groups requests for the same data within a short period. Then forwards only a single request to the database; thus, preventing the thundering herd problem.The data server notifies the crawler about data changes in repositories over websockets.Yet network interruptions occur, so the crawler periodically checks repositories. It then compares the data against its local replica to find data changes.Also requests are rate-limited to keep the system operational.HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) is returned in response headers when the rate limit threshold is exceeded. Interactions between servers are also rate-limited to avoid abuse in the decentralized architecture. A new data server’s request limit capacity is increased over time, based on trust, to keep the crawler running smoothly.Besides a user is only allowed up to 1,666 requests an hour to reduce bot activity.Bluesky has more than 28 million users; it became an independent company in 2021.Although anybody can host a server on ATProto, most Bluesky services are now run by a single company.ATProto and Bluesky look like an interesting new approach to social networks.👋  -Do you want to level up at work and better understand technical discussions?My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than 37 minutes a month.This is the first deep dive article in this newsletter; it's a free preview.Yet future deep dives, starting this February, are available only to paid subscribers.And subscription fees will be way higher than the current fees.So pledge now to get access at a very low price."This newsletter gave me ideas on how to build scalable systems."

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​

Coming after an unprecedented campaign season that saw Trump’s felony conviction in a “hush money” case, multiple assassination attempts against him, and President Joe Biden’s exit from the race just four months before the election, “Trump’s Comeback” tells the story of Trump’s return to the presidency, overcoming obstacles and opposition.

The film investigates how Trump’s comeback had roots dating back decades and offers a valuable primer on his approach to life and politics as his second term begins.

The documentary is drawn from FRONTLINE’s vast archive of incisive reporting on Trump across nearly a decade as well as new interviews with White House insiders and journalists conducted after Trump’s 2024 election victory.

“In the scope of American history, it’s almost unbelievable. In the scope of Donald Trump’s life, it’s kind of routine,” Trump biographer Marc Fisher says in the film. “The story of his life is massive swings between utter failure and glorious victory.”

“Trump’s Comeback” is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group, Ltd. The director is Michael Kirk. The producers are Michael Kirk, Mike Wiser and Vanessa Fica. The writers are Michael Kirk and Mike Wiser. The reporters are Vanessa Fica and Brooke Nelson Alexander. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

The company claims the model performs at levels comparable to OpenAI's o1 simulated reasoning (SR) model on several math and coding benchmarks.Alongside the release of the main DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1 models, DeepSeek published six smaller "DeepSeek-R1-Distill" versions ranging from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters. These distilled models are based on existing open source architectures like Qwen and Llama, trained using data generated from the full R1 model. The smallest version can run on a laptop, while the full model requires far more substantial computing resources.The releases immediately caught the attention of the AI community because most existing open-weights models—which can often be run and fine-tuned on local hardware—have lagged behind proprietary models like OpenAI's o1 in so-called reasoning benchmarks. Having these capabilities available in an MIT-licensed model that anyone can study, modify, or use commercially potentially marks a shift in what's possible with publicly available AI models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump’s Road from Jan. 6 Back to the White House | Trump&apos;s Comeback | FRONTLINE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS7UMDHz3Qc</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JS7UMDHz3Qc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:28:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the days after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, a second Trump presidency seemed out of the question to many.

--

In 1968, the American Heart Association made an announcement that would influence people’s diets for decades: they recommended that people avoid eating more than three eggs a week. Their reasoning was that the cholesterol packed into egg yolks could increase cardiovascular disease risk. So, what exactly is cholesterol? And is it actually bad for you? Hei Man Chan digs into this complex molecule.

Every time you request a ride, track your driver, or make a payment, these backend APIs handle the request. are responsible for optimizing these APIs, improving ride-matching algorithms, securing transactions, and ensuring a smooth experience for millions of users.The backend APIs handle , but they —which isn't practical for everyday users. That’s why companies build a frontend (user interface) on top of these APIs, allowing users to interact with the system .When you enter your pickup & destination address, the frontend sends an API request to  and displays available cars.Once the trip is complete, the frontend may call the process payment API to display the receipt.APIs come in different forms depending on , , and .1. Open APIs (Public APIs)Open APIs, also known as , are accessible to external developers with minimal restrictions.Companies provide these APIs to encourage  to integrate their services and build new applications on top of them.Example: YouTube Data APINormally, when you use the , it makes  to fetch your video feed, search for content, or post comments. However, YouTube also provides a  that allows developers to access some of this functionality .For example, the  allows developers to fetch video results based on a keyword. If you send a request to the API with "machine learning tutorial" as the search term, it will return a structured response (JSON format) containing a list of relevant videos, including titles, descriptions, thumbnails, and video links.This is incredibly useful because it enables developers to build custom applications on top of YouTube.2. Internal APIs (Private APIs), also known as , are designed xclusively for internal use within an organization. Unlike Open APIs, these are not accessible to external developers and are used to facilitate seamless communication between different internal systems within a company.Let’s take  as an example. When you place an order, you might assume that a single system processes your request. In reality,  (order processing, inventory, payment, logistics etc..) work together behind the scenes to fulfill your order efficiently.Each of these APIs , but they communicate through well-defined protocols to ensure a smooth and efficient process.Internal APIs allow companies to break down their applications into smaller, manageable services, making it easier to scale. Developers can  across different projects, reducing  and speeding up development.The first two types of APIs we discussed—Open APIs and Internal APIs—are functional and serve  like fetching weather data or booking a ride.But there’s another category of APIs that developers use daily:  (also called  or ).These APIs don’t connect different applications; instead, they provide predefined functions within a programming language or framework to make development easier.Python’s built-in list APIWhen working with lists, Python provides a set of built-in functions (methods) to manipulate data.numbers = [5, 3, 8, 1, 4] numbers.sort()  # API call to sort the list  fruits = ["apple", "banana"] fruits.append("orange")  # API call to add an element  fruits.pop()  # API call to remove the last elementInstead of writing sorting algorithms from scratch, developers can use  or  in Python.Code APIs are not just limited to built-in programming language functions. Take , an AI/ML library. It provides a  for training machine learning models without needing to implement complex mathematical operations from scratch.For example, creating a  using TensorFlow's API is as simple as:import tensorflow as tf model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu")])Programming APIs abstract away complexity so that developers can focus on building solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.APIs communicate using different protocols and architectures that define how requests are sent, how responses are formatted, and how data is exchanged between systems.1. REST (Representational State Transfer)REST is the most widely used API communication method today. It is lightweight, stateless, and scalable, making it perfect for web services and mobile applications. REST APIs follow a set of design principles and use  (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations.REST APIs are based on , and each resource is accessed through a . The API follows the , meaning the client sends a request, and the server processes it and sends a response.Example: REST API for a BookstoreRetrieve a list of books (GET Request):GET https://api.bookstore.com/books[   { "id": 1, "title": "Clean Code", "author": "Robert C. Martin" },   { "id": 2, "title": "The Pragmatic Programmer", "author": "Andrew Hunt" } ]2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)SOAP is an older API communication method that relies on XML-based messaging. Unlike REST, which is lightweight, SOAP is more structured and secure, making it ideal for banking, healthcare, and enterprise applications.SOAP messages are sent using  and require a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file, which defines the API's available functions and request structure.Example: SOAP API for a Banking Service Fetching account balance<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:bank="http://bank.example.com/">    <soapenv:Header/>    <soapenv:Body>       <bank:GetAccountBalance>          <bank:accountNumber>123456</bank:accountNumber>       </bank:GetAccountBalance>    </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope> <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">    <soapenv:Body>       <bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>          <bank:balance>5000.00</bank:balance>       </bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>    </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope>GraphQL is an alternative to REST that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, making it more efficient for modern applications. Unlike REST, which requires multiple API calls to fetch related data, GraphQL can fetch all necessary data in a single request.Instead of predefined endpoints, GraphQL exposes a , and the client sends queries to request specific fields.Example: Fetching a user's profile and their recent posts in a single request.{   user(id: 123) {     name     email     posts {       title       likes     }   } }{   "data": {     "user": {       "name": "Alice",       "email": "alice@example.com",       "posts": [         { "title": "Hello World", "likes": 100 },         { "title": "GraphQL is Amazing!", "likes": 200 }       ]     }   } }gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance API communication method that uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) instead of JSON or XML, making it faster and more efficient.gRPC uses  instead of text-based formats, reducing payload size and it supports , meaning the client and server can send data at the same time.Using an API might seem complex at first, but it follows a simple  pattern.Here’s a guide on how to find, access, and interact with an API step by step:Step 1: Find an API to UseBefore using an API, you need to  for your needs. APIs are available for different services like weather data, finance, social media, etc.Official API Documentation:Step 2: Read the API DocumentationAPI documentation explains how to use the API, available endpoints, authentication, and response formats.The OpenWeatherMap API allows users to fetch real-time weather data. Here's a breakdown of its key components:https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=city_name&appid=YOUR_API_KEY: City name (e.g., ): API Key (required for access)Step 3: Get API Access (API Key / Authentication)Most APIs  to prevent unauthorized access and manage usage limits.Common Authentication Methods:A unique key provided by the API serviceSecure login via Google, Github, etc.Token-based authenticationUsername + password (Base64 encoded)Example: Getting an API Key (OpenWeather API)Sign up at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up.Go to the  section and generate a key.Use the API key in requests:GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEYStep 4: Test the API Using Postman or cURLBefore writing code,  to see how it responds.Option 1: Using Postman (Recommended for Beginners)Click , enter the API endpoint URL (https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY).Select  as the HTTP method.Click  and view the response in .Option 2: Using cURL (For Command Line Users)You can also test APIs directly from the  using .curl -X GET "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New+York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY"Step 5: Write Code to Call the APINow that you’ve tested the API, it’s time to integrate it into your application.Example: Calling an API in Pythonimport requests  url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY" response = requests.get(url)  if response.status_code == 200:     data = response.json()     print(f"Temperature: {data['main']['temp']}°C") else:     print("Error:", response.status_code) – Sends an API request. – Converts response to JSON.if response.status_code == 200 – Checks if the request was successful.Step 6: Handle Errors & Rate LimitsAPIs don’t always return perfect responses. You should handle: (e.g., wrong city name). (e.g., expired API keys). (e.g., exceeding request limits).Example: Handling API Errors in Pythonif response.status_code == 200:     data = response.json()     print(f"Weather: {data['weather'][0]['description']}") elif response.status_code == 401:     print("Error: Invalid API key") elif response.status_code == 404:     print("Error: City not found") else:     print(f"Unexpected error: {response.status_code}")Step 7: Use API Responses in Your ApplicationOnce you fetch data from an API, you can display it dynamically in a web or mobile app. You can build a weather dashboard using the OpenWeatherMap API.Fetch live weather data from the API.Parse and extract relevant details (temperature, humidity, condition).Display the weather report in a user-friendly format.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

subprojects, and we will be covering SIG Architecture:
Enhancements.In this SIG Architecture spotlight we talked with Kirsten
Garrison, lead of the Enhancements subproject.The Enhancements subprojectFrederico (FSM): Hi Kirsten, very happy to have the opportunity to talk about the Enhancements
subproject. Let's start with some quick information about yourself and your role.: I’m a lead of the Enhancements subproject of SIG-Architecture and
currently work at Google. I first got involved by contributing to the service-catalog project with
the help of Carolyn Van Slyck. With time, I joined the Release
team,
eventually becoming the Enhancements Lead and a Release Lead shadow. While on the release team, I
worked on some ideas to make the process better for the SIGs and Enhancements team (the opt-in
process) based on my team’s experiences. Eventually, I started attending Subproject meetings and
contributing to the Subproject’s work.FSM: You mentioned the Enhancements subproject: how would you describe its main goals and areas of
intervention?FSM: The improvement of the KEP process was (and is) one in which SIG Architecture was heavily
involved. Could you explain the process to those that aren’t aware of it?: Every release, the SIGs let the
Release Team know which features they intend to work on to be put into the release. As mentioned
above, the prerequisite for these changes is a KEP - a standardized design document that all authors
must fill out and approve in the first weeks of the release cycle. Most features will move
through 3
phases:
alpha, beta and finally GA so approving a feature represents a significant commitment for the SIG.The KEP serves as the full source of truth of a feature. The KEP
template
has different requirements based on what stage a feature is in, but it generally requires a detailed
discussion of the design and the impact as well as providing artifacts of stability and
performance. The KEP takes quite a bit of iterative work between authors, SIG reviewers, api review
team and the Production Readiness Review team before it is approved. Each set of reviewers is
looking to make sure that the proposal meets their standards in order to have a stable and
performant Kubernetes release. Only after all approvals are secured, can an author go forth and
merge their feature in the Kubernetes code base.FSM: I see, quite a bit of additional structure was added. Looking back, what were the most
significant improvements of that approach?: In general, I think that the improvements with the most impact had to do with focusing on
the core intent of the KEP. KEPs exist not just to memorialize designs, but provide a structured way
to discuss and come to an agreement about different facets of the change. At the core of the KEP
process is communication and consideration.To that end, some of the significant changes revolve around a more detailed and accessible KEP
template. A significant amount of work was put in over time to get the
k/enhancements repo into its current form -- a
directory structure organized by SIG with the contours of the modern KEP template (with
Proposal/Motivation/Design Details subsections). We might take that basic structure for granted
today, but it really represents the work of many people trying to get the foundation of this process
in place over time.As Kubernetes matures, we’ve needed to think about more than just the end goal of getting a single
feature merged. We need to think about things like: stability, performance, setting and meeting user
expectations. And as we’ve thought about those things the template has grown more detailed. The
addition of the Production Readiness Review was major as well as the enhanced testing requirements
(varying at different stages of a KEP’s lifecycle).: We’re currently working on two things:Creating a Process KEP template. Sometimes people want to harness the KEP process for
significant changes that are more process oriented rather than feature oriented. We want to
support this because memorializing changes is important and giving people a better tool to do so
will only encourage more discussion and transparency. While our template changes aim to be as non-disruptive as possible, we
believe that it will be easier to track and communicate those changes to the community better with
a versioned KEP template and the policies that go alongside such versioning.Both features will take some time to get right and fully roll out (just like a KEP feature) but we
believe that they will both provide improvements that will benefit the community at large.FSM: You mentioned improvements: I remember when project boards for Enhancement tracking were
introduced in recent releases, to great effect and unanimous applause from release team members. Was
this a particular area of focus for the subproject?: The Subproject provided support to the Release Team’s Enhancement team in the migration away
from using the spreadsheet to a project board. The collection and tracking of enhancements has
always been a logistical challenge. During my time on the Release Team, I helped with the transition
to an opt-in system of enhancements, whereby the SIG leads "opt-in" KEPs for release tracking. This
helped to enhance communication between authors and SIGs before any significant work was undertaken
on a KEP and removed toil from the Enhancements team. This change used the existing tools to avoid
introducing too many changes at once to the community. Later, the Release Team approached the
Subproject with an idea of leveraging GitHub Project Boards to further improve the collection
process. This was to be a move away from the use of complicated spreadsheets to using repo-native
labels on k/enhancement issues and project boards.FSM: That surely adds an impact on simplifying the workflow...: Removing sources of friction and promoting clear communication is very important to the
Enhancements Subproject. At the same time, it’s important to give careful consideration to
decisions that impact the community as a whole. We want to make sure that changes are balanced to
give an upside and while not causing any regressions and pain in the rollout. We supported the
Release Team in ideation as well as through the actual migration to the project boards. It was a
great success and exciting to see the team make high impact changes that helped everyone involved in
the KEP process!FSM: For those reading that might be curious and interested in helping, how would you describe the
required skills for participating in the sub-project?: Familiarity with KEPs either via experience or taking time to look through the
kubernetes/enhancements repo is helpful. All are welcome to participate if interested - we can take
it from there.FSM: Excellent! Many thanks for your time and insight -- any final comments you would like to
share with our readers?: The Enhancements process is one of the most important parts of Kubernetes and requires
enormous amounts of coordination and collaboration of people and teams across the project to make it
successful. I’m thankful and inspired by everyone’s continued hard work and dedication to making the
project great. This is truly a wonderful community.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Make computing personal again (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/128</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/128/changelog-news-128.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Benj Edwards wants to put the “personal” back in “personal computer”, the answer.ai folks took Devin for a month-long spin, Asaf Zamir explains why senior engineers can remain ICs and still have a fulfilling career, Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti rethinks documentation by putting user actions first & Tero Piirainen lays out his case for Nue, the standards first web framework.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

Phoronix says the release has "plenty of fine features":
Linux 6.13 comes with the introduction of the AMD 3D V-Cache Optimizer driver for benefiting multi-CCD Ryzen X3D processors. The new AMD EPYC 9005 "Turin" server processors will now default to AMD P-State rather than ACPI CPUFreq for better power efficiency.... 
Linux 6.13 also brings more Rust programming language infrastructure and more.
 
Phoronix notes that Linux 6.13 also brings "the start of Intel Xe3 graphics bring-up, support for many older (pre-M1) Apple devices like numerous iPads and iPhones, NVMe 2.1 specification support, and AutoFDO and Propeller optimization support when compiling the Linux kernel with the LLVM Clang compiler." 

And some lucky Linux kernel developers will also be getting a guitar pedal soldered by Linus Torvalds himself, thanks to a generous offer he announced a week ago:

For _me_ a traditional holiday activity tends to be a LEGO build or two, since that's often part of the presents... But in addition to the LEGO builds, this year I also ended up doing a number of guitar pedal kit builds ("LEGO for grown-ups with a soldering iron"). Not because I play guitar, but because I enjoy the tinkering, and the guitar pedals actually do something and are the right kind of "not very complex, but not some 5-minute 555 LED blinking thing"... 
[S]ince I don't actually have any _use_ for the resulting pedals (I've already foisted off a few only unsuspecting victims^Hfriends), I decided that I'm going to see if some hapless kernel developer would want one.... as an admittedly pretty weak excuse to keep buying and building kits... 

"It may be worth noting that while I've had good success so far, I'm a software person with a soldering iron. You have been warned... [Y]ou should set your expectations along the lines of 'quality kit built by a SW person who doesn't know one end of a guitar from the other.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Charlemagne</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/charlemagne</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67892eb0c2824244c27b929f/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=3pCPGiAXWzux-J-3YCe1OwbmIbvcy6B9C-AaxFO1HJk" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jennifer Burns: Milton Friedman, Ayn Rand, Economics, Capitalism, Freedom | Lex Fridman Podcast #457</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Rz-4ulRKnz4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 19:27:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jennifer Burns is a historian of ideas, focusing on the evolution of economic, political, and social ideas in the United States in the 20th century.

The Los Angeles wildfires have destroyed more than 12,000 structures and at least 24 people have died with more unaccounted for as multiple wildfires, fueled by severe drought conditions and strong winds, continue to burn. Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs estimate that the destruction will cost insurers as much as $30 billion dollars and after accounting for non-insured damages, the total costs will balloon to $40 billion. The ongoing fires, already appear to be the costliest wildfire event in California history.

Efficient Deployment of Models at the Edge // MLOps Podcast #284 with Krishna Sridhar, Vice President of Qualcomm.Big shout out to Qualcomm for sponsoring this episode!

// Abstract
Qualcomm® AI Hub helps to optimize, validate, and deploy machine learning models on-device for vision, audio, and speech use cases.

With Qualcomm® AI Hub, you can:

Convert trained models from frameworks like PyTorch and ONNX for optimized on-device performance on Qualcomm® devices.
Profile models on-device to obtain detailed metrics including runtime, load time, and compute unit utilization.
Verify numerical correctness by performing on-device inference.
Easily deploy models using Qualcomm® AI Engine Direct, TensorFlow Lite, or ONNX Runtime.

The Qualcomm® AI Hub Models repository contains a collection of example models that use Qualcomm® AI Hub to optimize, validate, and deploy models on Qualcomm® devices.

Qualcomm® AI Hub automatically handles model translation from source framework to device runtime, applying hardware-aware optimizations, and performs physical performance/numerical validation. The system automatically provisions devices in the cloud for on-device profiling and inference. The following image shows the steps taken to analyze a model using Qualcomm® AI Hub.

// Bio
Krishna Sridhar leads engineering for Qualcomm™ AI Hub, a system used by more than 10,000 AI developers spanning 1,000 companies to run more than 100,000 models on Qualcomm platforms. 

Prior to joining Qualcomm, he was Co-founder and CEO of Tetra AI which made its easy to efficiently deploy ML models on mobile/edge hardware. 

Prior to Tetra AI, Krishna helped design Apple's CoreML which was a software system mission critical to running several experiences at Apple including Camera, Photos, Siri, FaceTime, Watch, and many more across all major Apple device operating systems and all hardware and IP blocks. 

He has a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India.

Rome is the birthplace of Baroque, the highly ornate and elaborate style of architecture, art and design that flourished in Europe in the 17th and first half of the 18th century. Unlike the Renaissance, which was all about control and perfect balance, the Baroque era was famous for its dramatic flair and sense of movement. 

In this episode, Great Cities Explained goes outside the galleries and museums, and inside three Baroque churches that still house works by Caravaggio, Pozzo and Bernini  today…. and cost nothing to visit.

Since then, its politics have drifted rightward. Titans of industry and finance are migrating there, creating what’s being called Wall Street South.

Dark matter has eluded us for many decades. Even our most advanced particle colliders and sophisticated underground detectors have come up short. But it may be that we can finally solve this mystery with a much simpler experiment, involving a ray of light, a good clock, and the planet Mars.

First, you're getting the Copilot-powered AI features that Microsoft has been rolling out to businesses and Copilot Pro subscribers, like summarizing or generating text in Word, drafting slideshows in PowerPoint based on a handful of criteria, or analyzing data in Excel. Second, you'll be paying more for the privilege of using those features, to the tune of an extra $3 a month or $30 a year.This raises the price of a Microsoft 365 Personal subscription from $7 a month or $70 a year to $10 and $100; a family subscription goes from $10 a month or $100 a year to $13 a month or $130 a year. For current subscribers, these prices go into effect the next time your plan renews.Current subscribers are also being given an escape hatch "for a limited time." "Classic" Personal and Family plans at the old prices with no Copilot features included will still be offered, but you'll need to go to the "services & subscriptions" page of your Microsoft account and attempt to cancel your existing subscription to be offered the discounted pricing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Romanovs: The Truth Behind The Downfall of the Russian Empire</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcS056KiJa0</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hcS056KiJa0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 18:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For three hundred years Russia was ruled by one family: the Romanovs.

--

Today, rats are often regarded as the most successful invasive species in the world. The most common species of rat scurried onto the scene roughly 1 to 3 million years ago in Asia. There, they craftily survived Earth’s most recent ice age, and eventually, began living around and with humans— though often at the mercy of human priorities. Max G. Levy traces the entangled history of human and rat.

On Tuesday, Microsoft finally patched the vulnerability. The status of Linux systems is still unclear.Tracked as CVE-2024-7344, the vulnerability made it possible for attackers who had already gained privileged access to a device to run malicious firmware during bootup. These types of attacks can be particularly pernicious because infections hide inside the firmware that runs at an early stage, before even Windows or Linux has loaded. This strategic position allows the malware to evade defenses installed by the OS and gives it the ability to survive even after hard drives have been reformatted. From then on, the resulting "bootkit" controls the operating system start.In place since 2012, Secure Boot is designed to prevent these types of attacks by creating a chain-of-trust linking each file that gets loaded. Each time a device boots, Secure Boot verifies that each firmware component is digitally signed before it’s allowed to run. It then checks the OS bootloader's digital signature to ensure that it's trusted by the Secure Boot policy and hasn't been tampered with. Secure Boot is built into the UEFI—short for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface—the successor to the BIOS that’s responsible for booting modern Windows and Linux devices.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Digital Forensics with Emre Tinaztepe</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/01/16/digital-forensics-with-emre-tinaztepe/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=digital-forensics-with-emre-tinaztepe</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED2585624665.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 10:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Digital forensics is the process of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting electronic data for investigative purposes.

It wasn’t a subject covered in college, and I had no prior experience building scalable systems.But, over time, I realized that you don’t need professional experience with distributed systems to pass system design interviews.Even experienced engineers often find these interviews challenging because the format is unique and requires a specific approach.The good news is that once you understand the , the , and , and learn how to connect them effectively, system design interviews become far less intimidating.In this article, I’ll share  that improved my system design interview skills and made it significantly easier—and hopefully, they’ll do the same for you.In a system design interview, the interviewer evaluates your ability to , , and .Here’s what they are looking for: Can you ask the right questions to clarify functional and non-functional requirements? Can you outline the main components of the system (e.g., clients, APIs, databases, caching, load balancers) and explain how they interact? Can your design handle increased traffic or scale with user growth?  Can you address single points of failure and ensure fault tolerance? Can you explain the pros and cons of your decisions and justify your choices? Can you dive into the details of critical components (e.g., database schema, caching strategy, API design)?Bottlenecks and Edge Cases: Can you identify potential issues and propose strategies to mitigate them? Can you articulate your ideas clearly and engage in a constructive discussion with the interviewer? Are you receptive to feedback and able to refine your design? Can you manage your time effectively and focus on high-impact components? Are you familiar with common system design patterns (e.g., sharding, replication, caching)? Can you discuss tools or technologies relevant to the problem?System design interviews typically last , which means managing your time effectively is crucial.A well-structured approach ensures you cover all key aspects of the design while leaving room for discussion and feedback with the interviewer.Here’s a framework you can follow:Clarifying Requirements (5-10 minutes): Understand functional and non-functional needs.High-Level Design (10-15 minutes): Outline the system's main components and overall architecture (e.g., clients, database, cache, load balancer, messaging queues).Database Design (5-8 minutes): Choose the appropriate database type (SQL, NoSQL, or hybrid). Define schemas and discuss partitioning, indexing, replication, and caching.API Design (5-8 minutes): Define intuitive and scalable APIs. List critical endpoints and their purpose.Deep Dive into Key Components (15-20 minutes): Discuss 2-3 critical components in detail.Handling Trade-Offs and Edge Cases (5-10 minutes): Highlight trade-offs, bottlenecks, and failure handling. Propose mitigation strategies.Address scalability, security and monitoring (5-10 minutes): Explain how your design handles growth, ensures security, and incorporates monitoring.You can adjust this framework based on the problem type and requirements.I haven’t included  here but I recommend minimal capacity estimation at the start to set context (e.g., "The system will handle 1 million requests per day").Avoid detailed calculations unless explicitly required. You don’t want to waste your precious time doing unnecessary maths calculation.A common mistake many candidates make is jumping directly into designing the system without fully understanding what needs to be built.System design questions are intentionally  and often underspecified. Interviewers deliberately withhold details, expecting you to ask the right questions to uncover the information you need.To succeed, start by clarifying the —the  and  the system must support.At this stage, avoid thinking about design, implementation, or technical specifics. The primary goal is to define  needs to be built, not  to build it or the scale it needs to support. Focus purely on understanding the "what."Based on the problem, list down the core features and use cases and confirm them with the interviewer.What specific features does the system need?Are there any must-have or optional features?What are the main objects and their relations?How the objects will interact with each other and access pattern?Can the system’s objects be modified after creation?What types of data will the system handle? For a chat application:Users should be able to send and receive messages.The primary objects are users and messages.Users should view all messages in chronological order.Messages may be edited or deleted after being sent.Messages may include text, images, and videos.Your aim is to ask just enough questions to gather a clear picture of all important use cases for the system.Once functional requirements are well-defined, shift your focus to non-functional requirements.These describe  the system should perform its functions.The most common non-functional requirements you should consider in a system design interview are: How quickly should the system respond to user requests? Should the system tolerate downtime? If yes, how much? Is strong or eventual consistency required? Are there any special security considerations or workflows?Questions to Clarify NFRs:What is the  of the system?How many users should it support?How many requests per second should the server handle?Is  acceptable? What is the cost of downtime for this system?Is the system  or ? What is the read-to-write ratio?Should updates be visible to users instantly, or is a delay acceptable?Are there any specific  concerns? Are there workflows involving sensitive data or code execution? For a chat application: 1 million daily active users, with up to 10,000 concurrent users per server. Aim for 99.99% uptime (no more than ~52 minutes of downtime per year). High read volume as users fetch messages frequently compared to writing messages. Messages should appear in real-time for recipients.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Record of Their Time (RA Winter Lecture)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHrTliHUt6k</link><author>Royal Armouries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qHrTliHUt6k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 02:57:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMX-XuiEkBi4-GDrYuniWg">Royal Armouries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Speakers: Dr Krysten Blackstone, Lecturer in International and Military History, University of Salford and Jonathan Jeffries

Soldiers in the Continental Army kept diaries as records of their service during the American Revolution, writing in them almost daily. These personal entries vary from short notations about the weather, to longer descriptions of their experiences and observations. However, new evidence suggests that on certain campaigns, a unique practice took place – soldiers sharing their diaries.

Our speakers will delve into the discovery of this unusual practice, closely examining the rare and overlooked examples to understand why soldiers shared their personal diaries and why they only did so during specific campaigns. Entries appear to have been copied from one soldier to another for certain periods of time, sometimes as long as months!

This lecture is an opportunity to engage with sources that have never been published and consider a practice rarely discussed in academic literature, all the while learning about some key campaigns of the American Revolutionary War as told by the soldiers themselves.

This is useful when you frequently connect to the same server using SSH protocol for remote login, server management, using IT automation tools over SSH or even running hourly backups. However, sometimes your SSH command (client) will not respond or get hung up on the session when using multiplexing. Typically, this happens when your public IP changes (IPv4 to IPv6 changes when using DNS names), VPN issues, or firewall cuts connections.

However, performance is said to be "really slow." How-To Geek reports: The latest Parallels Desktop 20.2 update adds early support for x86 emulation on Apple Silicon, allowing traditional x86 PC operating systems to work on newer Mac computers. There were already apps like UTM that could do it (most of them are based on QEMU), but this feature uses Parallels' "proprietary emulation engine" paired with Apple's built-in hypervisor. [...] Parallels on Apple Silicon can now "run existing x86_64 Windows 10, Windows 11*, Windows Server 2019/2022, and some Linux distributives with UEFI BIOS via Parallels Emulator." You can also create new Windows 10 21H2 and Windows Server 2022 virtual machines if needed.
 
There are some big limitations. You can only run 64-bit x86 operating systems -- sorry, FreeDOS fans -- but those 64-bit operating systems can run 32-bit applications. There's also no support for USB devices, nested virtualization (so WSL2 won't work), or the Parallels hypervisor. Performance will also be "really slow," since x86 instructions have to be translated to ARM. The company said, "Windows boot time is about 2-7 minutes, depending on your hardware. Windows operating system responsiveness is also low."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Who Owns Greenland?</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/who-owns-greenland</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/678573f83f68018e6a0c098d/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=aK2ez0HAnyG6saKrZTvRIj4SynUteRmJb9DZo3TAn-U" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NuPhy Air60HE keyboard review (Gateron Low-profile Magnetic Jade Pro)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGI03Vdsj5s</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tGI03Vdsj5s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:31:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Skip to 7:40 for a typing demonstration.

It has a big roster of heroes with a ton of variety across them, no role queue, and 6v6, all of which are important to a great hero shooter. Although it lifts more than a few of Overwatch's ideas, it is actively targeting and addressing some of the biggest complaints players have about Blizzard's shooter. Marvel Rivals expands on familiar ideas in smart ways and has a visually striking and distinct art style. Add in that it's a fun multiplayer experience and it makes it far more than just another also-ran hero shooter clone.Opting for 6v6 and a third-person camera view, Marvel Rivals has a vast variety of playstyles across its launch roster. Offering everything from simple shooting-focused heroes like Punisher to complex melee heroes like Spider-Man, all the while making it feel cohesive. Although it will undoubtedly be chaotic for players trying a hero shooter like this for the first time, there are a variety of heroes that make picking up the game simple and an impressive roster of alternative picks that can gradually increase complexity.It does have limited main game modes at launch, with only Domination, which involves fighting over a control point; Convoy, where a team escorts a payload; and Convergence, which is a combination of the two. These are split across a variety of maps taken from the Marvel multiverse, with locations like Tokyo 2099, Yggsgard, and the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. These different locations provide a ton of environmental variety, with the pristine look of Asgard contrasted with the dense buildings of Tokyo 2099. While the visual styles don't change the flow of the game, the map layouts do. For example, both Tokyo 2099 and Klyntar have hybrid maps--where the attacking team must capture a control point, which unlocks a payload to push--but Tokyo 2099 has multiple buildings blocking the defenders' line of sight, while on Klyntar the area from spawn to the point is much more open, promoting more long-range hero options. It can become visually stale, but more importantly, having fewer modes means that your team's strategies don't shift as much from match to match, which can result in them blending together because each individual match doesn't feel unique, aside from the team compositions.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Europe Rebuilt After WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqljXZGTfug</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WqljXZGTfug?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As the world breathed a sigh of relief at the end of the largest, bloodiest conflict in human history, more struggle was already on the horizon.

These screens occupy the dimensions of your terminal by default. While you can have many different screens in a single application, only one screen may be active at a time.When you create your  class, Textual will create a screen object implicitly. Yes, Textual requires you to have at least one screen or your application won’t work. If you do not create a new screen or switch to a different one, the default screen is where your widgets will get mounted or composed to.Screens are a great way to organize your application. Many applications have settings pages, help pages, and more. These are just a few examples of how you can use screens.Now that you know what a screen is, you’re ready to learn how to create new ones!When you create an application, you create a  implicitly. But how do you create your own ? Fortunately, Textual has made that easy. All you need to do is import the  class from  and extend it as needed.You can style screens the same way you do other widgets, except for the dimensions as screens are always the same size as your terminal window.To see how this all works, you will create an application with two screens:You second screen, which will be greenYou will be able to switch between the screens using a button. Each screen has its own button and its own event or message handler.Open up your favorite Python IDE and create a new file called  with the following contents:# two_screens.py

from textual import on
from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.screen import Screen
from textual.widgets import Button

class GreenScreen(Screen):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        self.styles.background = "green"
        yield Button("Main Screen", id="main")

    @on(Button.Pressed, "#main")
    def on_main(self) -> None:
        self.dismiss()


class MainAop(App):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Button("Switch", id="switch")

    @on(Button.Pressed, "#switch")
    def on_switch(self) -> None:
        self.push_screen(GreenScreen())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = MainAop()
    app.run()You use Textual’s handy  decorator to match against the button’s . That keeps the message from bubbling around to other event handlers, which is what could happen if you had used , for example.When you run your application, you will see something like this:Try clicking the buttons and switching between the screens.Of course, you don’t need to use button’s at all, if you don’t want to. You could use keyboard shortcuts instead. Why not give that a try?Go back to your Python IDE and create a new file called  with this code in it:# two_screens_keys_only.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.screen import Screen
from textual.widgets import Label


class GreenScreen(Screen):
    BINDINGS = [("escape", "app.pop_screen", "Dismiss the screen")]

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        self.styles.background = "green"
        yield Label("Second Screen")


class MainAop(App):
    SCREENS = {"green": GreenScreen}
    BINDINGS = [("n", "push_screen('green')", "Green Screen")]

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Label("Main screen")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = MainAop()
    app.run()Using keyboard shortcuts makes your code a little less verbose. However, since you aren’t using a  widget, the shortcuts are not shown on-screen to the user. When you are on the main screen, you must press the letter “n” on your keyboard to switch to the . Then when you want to switch back, you press “Esc” or escape.Here’s what the screen looks like on the :Now try using the keys mentioned to swap between the two screens. Feel free to change the keyboard bindings to keys of your own choosing.Textual can do much more with Screens than what is covered in this brief tutorial. However, you can use this information as a great starting point for learning how to add one more additional screens to your GUI in your terminal.Play around with these examples and then run over to the Textual documentation to learn about some of the other widgets you can add to bring your application to life.If you’d like to learn more about Textual, check out my book: Creating TUI Applications with Textual and Python, which you can find on the following websites:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>One of the most controversial medical procedures in history - Jenell Johnson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3d2DlLX7xw</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/w3d2DlLX7xw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 16:01:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Uncover the history of the lobotomy, and find out why it's considered one of the most controversial procedures of the 20th century.

--

In 1935, researchers found that after removing the frontal lobes of two chimps, they no longer experienced frustration or anxiety. Neurologist Egas Moniz believed that replicating this in humans could cure mental illness— leading to one of the most controversial and destructive medical treatments of the 20th century: the lobotomy. Jenell Johnson uncovers the history of the procedure.

Both Donkey Kong Country and the Super Marios are classic side-scrolling platformers at their core, but DKC has been known less for joyful leaping and more for clenching your jaw. Now as the Nintendo Switch approaches its eighth year and Nintendo is increasingly reaching into its back catalog for ports, DKC Returns is back with a package that combines all the features of the Wii and 3DS versions--including some assists and visual enhancements--but still feels tough-as-nails in a way that could push away more casual platformer fans.DKC Returns HD does retain the tweaks made to the 2013 3DS port, including a Modern mode (originally called New mode in the 3DS version) with additional items in Cranky's shop and an extra pip of health. The items in Cranky's shop are especially tuned to let you selectively tweak the difficulty, since the banana coins currency are so plentiful that you'll almost always have enough to spare on an item or two. Those items range from help finding collectible puzzle pieces to temporary invincibility. You can always opt for the original mode to play with the original Wii difficulty, if that's more your flavor. And it does look nicely polished on Switch, especially on the OLED screen. That said, the character models look relatively simplistic compared to Tropical Freeze, a 2014 Wii U game that was already ported to Switch in 2018.The Modern mode is meant to sand off the edges of the notoriously punishing game and make it more approachable, but make no mistake: This is still a brutally difficult game. Even with three hearts instead of the original two, it's very easy to lose multiple lives (or near the end, tens of lives) in a single stage as you learn its rhythms and assorted traps. And the difficulty in DKC Returns is true to its roots, which centers heavily on memorization. The game frequently introduces threats too quickly to react to the first time, and DK himself feels stiff and heavy compared to the acrobatic Mario. Trickier stages will even give the appearance of one type of obstacle and then frustratingly punish you for reacting to the fake-out.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Heroku and the Twelve-Factor App with Vish Abrams</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/01/14/heroku-and-the-twelve-factor-app-with-vish-abrams/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=heroku-and-the-twelve-factor-app-with-vish-abrams</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED5934449149.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 10:00:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Heroku is a cloud platform-as-a-service that enables developers to build, deploy, and manage applications.

You Need to Lay the Right FoundationCoding interviews aren’t just about algorithms—they’re about confidence.Yet one of the biggest fears is walking in and realizing you’re not prepared for the basics.The solution? Master these core areas:💡  Focus on one topic at a time. Consistency over cramming—it works.I remember spending hours on my first binary tree problem, convinced I’d never get it.But once I learned to break the problem down step by step, the complexity melted away.2. Then, You Need to Start Recognizing PatternsEver feel like you’ve solved hundreds of problems but still get stuck?It’s not about solving —it’s about solving smarter.Coding problems often follow predictable patterns.When you recognize the underlying structure, the solution becomes much simpler.Here are a few patterns worth mastering: Ideal for sorted arrays. For substring or interval problems. For efficiently finding an element in a sorted list.To answer range sum queries in constant time.For finding the next/previous greater or smaller element.For exploring all possible configurations.💡  Pick a pattern and dive deep. Solve 5–10 problems for each, focusing on understanding  the pattern works.Think of patterns like shortcuts on a map—they get you to the solution faster, with fewer dead ends.3. At Some Point, You Need to Simulate the Real DealHere’s the fear no one talks about: freezing during an interview.You know the material, but when it’s time to perform, your brain says, “Nope.”Sweaty palms, a simple BFS problem, and 20 minutes of staring at the screen like it was written in ancient Greek.Recreate interview conditions so the real thing feels like just another session.Set a timer and work on a problem without syntax hints.Use a whiteboard or plain text editor—no IDE crutches.Practice explaining your thought process out loud.💡  Schedule a mock interview with a peer or use an online platform.It’s awkward at first, but it’s the fastest way to build confidence.4. If You Don’t Have Much Time, You Need to Focus on High-Impact TopicsNot all topics are prioritized equally.Spending hours on niche problems might feel productive, but it won’t help when interviewers hit you with the classics. Search and Sorting algorithms, two pointers.: Reversal, cycle detection, and partitioning.: Binary trees, binary search trees, and traversals. DFS, BFS, topological sorting, and shortest path algorithms.: Permutations, combinations, Sudoku solver, and N-Queens problem.: Top-K elements, and merging K sorted lists.: Word search, autocomplete, and prefix matching. Problems like Knapsack or Longest Common Subsequence.💡  Track your progress on high-yield topics using tools like Notion or Trello.Seeing your wins pile up is a great motivator.The goal isn’t to know everything—it’s to be a pro at what matters most.5. If You Want to be an Engineer, You Need to Communicate Like an EngineerCoding interviews aren’t just about solving problems—they’re about showing  you solve problems.Clear communication sets you apart. Restate it to show you understand. Share your strategy before you start coding. Explain your logic, handle edge cases, and think aloud.💡  Record yourself solving a problem.Play it back to catch moments where you over-complicate or skip explanations.Interviewers don’t expect perfection—they expect clarity and problem-solving skills.6. And Finally, You Need to Build ResilienceLet’s talk about failure.It’s not if—it’s when. But every mistake is a step closer to mastery.During my ICPC journey, I submitted hundreds of wrong answers.Some were silly oversights; others were genuinely tough problems.But every “wrong answer” was a chance to learn something new.💡  Keep a failure journal.Write down problems you struggled with, what you learned, and how you’ll tackle similar issues in the future.Failure isn’t the end; it’s the beginning of better solutions.Here are a few resources I personally used to improve at problem-solving:Section for training as a team.Educational section to learn new topics.Highly engaged community and blogs where people go beyond the basics.Slightly advanced topics.The most beautiful algorithmic problems you will ever see.If you’ve ever doubted your ability to land that dream job, let me be the proof: persistence, focus, and the right system can transform everything.And leveraging your competitive advantage will change your life—more on that in this post:Competitive Programming Changed My Life ForeverI’m writing to you from Gothenburg, Sweden—a place where I’ve found the perfect balance between meaningful work and a fulfilling life…a month ago · 31 likes · 7 comments · Alberto GonzalezYour dream job isn’t just about a bigger paycheck.

The Register reports: The odd offer appeared in his weekly state-of-the-kernel post, which on Sunday US time informed the Linux world that release candidate (rc) seven for version 6.13 of the Linux kernel "is slightly bigger than normal, but considering the timing, it's pretty much where I would have expected, and nothing really stands out." Torvalds therefore expects version 6.13 to debut next week, meaning it will arrive after his preferred seven release candidates and without delays caused by the usual holiday-period slowdown. Torvalds then added a postscript in which he revealed that he often uses the holiday season to build LEGO, which he frequently receives for Christmas and his late December birthday.
 
He kept up that tradition last year, but "also ended up doing a number of guitar pedal kit builds" which he described as "LEGO for grown-ups with a soldering iron." [...] Torvalds doesn't play guitar, but did the builds "because I enjoy the tinkering, and the guitar pedals actually do something and are the right kind of "not very complex, but not some 5-minute 555 LED blinking thing.'" He enjoyed the experience and wants to build more pedals, so has decided to give one away to a random kernel developer -- both as an act of generosity and to "check to see if anybody actually ever reads these weekly rc announcements of mine." Torvalds rated his past pedal-building efforts a "good success so far" but warned entrants "I'm a software person with a soldering iron."
 
"I will test the result to the best of my abilities, and the end result may actually work ... but you should set your expectations along the lines of "quality kit built by a SW person who doesn't know one end of a guitar from the other.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EP31 Kushite Conversations</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1wz1WPfI34</link><author>Dan Carlin</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/N1wz1WPfI34?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 22:26:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3RcjbuyF5M1U4R62zjE3hg">Dan Carlin</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dan talks with writer, broadcaster and journalist Zeinab Badawi about the ancient African kingdom of Kush and her book on African history.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The new $30,000 side hustle (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/127</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/127/changelog-news-127.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 20:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bloomberg reports on a concerning new trend in tech hiring, Sean Goedecke has a lot to say about large established codebases, Jacob Bartlett thinks Apple is ruining Swift’s original vision, Ahmed Khaleel built a cool tool for turning GitHub repos into interactive diagrams & Bridget Harris goes deep on the potential of crypto stablecoins to disrupt Visa and Mastercard’s duopoly.Changelog++ members save 1 minute on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

It's the ultimate power fantasy, with each swing of your weapon sending bodies careening through the air in every conceivable direction as the KO counter ticks up into the thousands. For almost 25 years, this basic formula has remained virtually unchanged, lending the series a fervent albeit niche following. Dynasty Warriors 9 attempted to evolve the formula, but the shift to a lifeless open world was a misstep that didn't mesh with the series' core appeal. Dynasty Warriors: Origins, as the name implies, sees Omega Force returning to its roots, emphasizing the large-scale, hack-and-slash action Dynasty Warriors is known for while implementing a number of clever new additions that achieve what Dynasty Warriors 9 failed to.If you're unfamiliar with the long-running series, Dynasty Warriors is based on Luo Guanzhong's 14th-century novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms--and the ancient history it's based on--loosely adapting the classic Chinese novel by taking some absurd creative liberties along the way. While previous games in the series have typically covered the bulk of the Three Kingdoms period from 184 AD to 280 AD, Origins tightly focuses on the early parts of the story, beginning with the rise of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and culminating in the decisive Battle of Chibi. Unlike the rest of the series, the story is also told from the perspective of an amnesiac warrior who's meeting legendary figures like Guan Yu, Dong Zhuo, and the fearsome Lü Bu for the first time. This setup is clearly designed with newcomers in mind, making the series' enduring legacy and myriad beloved characters much more palatable for new players to dive into for the first time.Still, that doesn't mean returning players will be left wanting. By focusing on the early events of the Three Kingdoms' tapestry, Omega Force has opted to delve into the time period in greater detail than before, with a renewed emphasis on storytelling and character development. Even minor figures are more fleshed out, while pivotal moments are given the gravitas they deserve. This is somewhat of a double-edged sword, however. The writing is generally solid, with defined, charming, and likable characters engaging in moral quandaries and battles of both wit and brawn, but the overabundance of cutscenes sometimes works to its detriment. Too many conversations simply feel derivative, either repeating plot points or adding little of substance to the narrative and your understanding of its ensemble cast of characters. This disrupts the game's pacing, leading to more than a few occasions where you're forced to wait impatiently for the next battle to arrive as you cycle through one superfluous conversation after another.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US splits world into three tiers for AI chip access</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/biden-administration-puts-quotas-on-global-ai-chip-sales/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/us_digital_flag_1-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 16:18:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday, the US government announced a new round of regulations on global AI chip exports, dividing the world into roughly three tiers of access. The rules create quotas for about 120 countries and allow unrestricted access for 18 close US allies while maintaining existing bans on China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.AI-accelerating GPU chips, like those manufactured by Nvidia, currently serve as the backbone for a wide variety of AI model deployments, such as chatbots like ChatGPT, AI video generators, self-driving cars, weapons targeting systems, and much more. The Biden administration fears that those chips could be used to undermine US national security.According to the White House, "In the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>One reason movies are so dark now</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJcnUUJlPA</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HSJcnUUJlPA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 13:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Digital cameras have driven this change, but not in the way you think.
