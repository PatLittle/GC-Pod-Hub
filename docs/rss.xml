The Rodd Charlottetown Hotel has been welcoming guests since 1931.
The oldest heritage hotel in Prince Edward Island, the property combines old world charm with modern amenities. 
With 115 rooms, a restaurant and Victorian-style conference rooms, the full-service hotel is a cornerstone of the downtown core.
It's one of four remaining hotels built across the country by Canadian National Railway.
In 2024, the historic property began an extensive $10 million renovation.

Thanks to a partnership between Ability New Brunswick and the Municipality of Grand Lake, supported by ACOA, rural communities are embracing inclusive design and transforming public spaces.  
   
This story shows how thoughtful collaboration can lead to lasting impact — and a more accessible future for everyone.

Executive Director of Ability NB, Haley Flaro, says:
“This is our first collaboration with ACOA, and it’s a shining example of what’s possible when federal partners work hand-in-hand with communities.”

Transcript:
Alyson:

It all started we were planning to make some renovations to the washroom facilities at the Chipman Heritage Centre.

We knew kinda through residents that they were not easily accessible in a wheelchair or mobility aid.

I ended up speaking with Ability New Brunswick. They let us know that they actually had a free accessibility review that they could do of our buildings.

We learned so much about tactical signage, making sure that our spaces are cane friendly.

It was so much more than just ensuring that people can enter the building.

And from there, we've really started a wonderful collaboration with them that we know will continue past just these buildings.

We have more throughout the municipality, and we are also just really doing our best to promote it to other private businesses in the community.


Haley Flaro:

I just love this collaboration because it’s a perfect example of community working with community.

And the large tourism that happens, especially in the Grand Lake area drawing more people in to the communities to be able to access important museums, infrastructure, you know, recreation areas.

It’s really critical., so we’re really proud of this collaboration.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Global Affairs Canada: We are Canada in the world. 🇨🇦🤝🌎</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Gl4dLBQCab8</link><author>Global Affairs Canada</author><category>youtube</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Gl4dLBQCab8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 8 Sep 2025 16:04:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIVMBvs03h74NSdQMH31jKA">Global Affairs Canada</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Global Affairs Canada works every day to shape a more peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable world for Canadians. 🍁]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>G7s In Canada</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in0zTVO4rMY</link><author>Global Affairs Canada</author><category>youtube</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/in0zTVO4rMY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 3 Sep 2025 12:01:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIVMBvs03h74NSdQMH31jKA">Global Affairs Canada</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Canada hosted the #G7 Summit for the 7th time this year.

A pioneer in the Canadian specialty food industry, the company is embracing innovation and automation so they can spread preserves and joy around the world!

Transcript - 
Built on old-fashioned values of quality and hospitality, the PEI Preserve Co. has been a pioneer in the Canadian specialty food industry since 1985.
Founded by Bruce and Shirley MacNaughton, a humble jar of handmade preserves quickly transformed into an iconic Island business.
The operation blossomed to include a river-front restaurant, gift shop, theatre café, 12 acres of gardens, a butterfly house...
...and of course...
...preserves!
The preserves are sold worldwide through the company’s online giftshop, and in three locations across the Island.
In 2022, the company was purchased by Adam and Marsha Doiron, who held strong ties to the business and saw its growth potential.
The Doirons celebrated the company’s 40th “Jam-iversary” in 2025, welcoming all who have been a part of the PEI Preserve Co. story.
It was a joyful afternoon full of flavour, music and reflection.
And special guest Chef Michael Smith opened the 5-millionth jar!
PEI Preserve Co. produces up to 100,000 jars per year, and demand continues to grow.
So, what’s next?
The Doirons have plans to expand the product line and scale up production to 500,000 jars per year by 2027.
The Government of Canada is helping businesses like PEI Preserve Co. become more productive and reach new markets.
ACOA is proud to support PEI Preserve Co. as they spread jam and joy around the world!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Treasury Board at a glance</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50r3Yuqeats</link><author>TBS Canada</author><category>youtube</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/50r3Yuqeats?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:35:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV7uvs-FoatgAuyzjpJTS3g">TBS Canada</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This video is also available in French: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKK5FauNZek

Transcript:
The Treasury Board is a Cabinet committee chaired by the President of the Treasury Board and composed of a Vice-Chair, four or more standing members, and alternate members.
Ministers play a corporate role and do not represent their individual portfolios when they take part in meetings.
The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat supports the Board administratively. It provides advice and recommendations.
The Treasury Board has two distinct functions known as Part A and Part B.
For Part A
Ministers will consider proposals—Treasury Board submissions—from sponsoring ministers. 
These submissions seek access to funding and/or authorities, such as the ability to enter into contracts or undertake projects, to advance the government’s agenda. 
Treasury Board also approves the ruleset governing financial and project management, contracting, and people and IT management in the government. 
As the employer, Treasury Board will also be asked to approve collective agreements for the federal public service. 
Treasury Board considers about 350 proposals per year.
For Part B: 
The Treasury Board also serves as the Governor in Council. It considers regulations and orders-in-council that are meant to protect the health, safety, or security of Canadians and the environment, and support a competitive and innovative economy.
Annually, the Treasury Board considers 100 to 200 regulatory proposals. 
It also considers 200 to 300 non-regulatory orders-in-council including those that authorize Canada to enter into international agreements, or bring legislation into force. 
Regulations and orders-in-council are typically made public after approval.
The Treasury Board usually meets once a week when Parliament is sitting, or more frequently when there are many submissions to consider. Each meeting includes a Part A and a Part B agenda and typically lasts two to three hours.  
Each Treasury Board submission, along with the Treasury Board Secretariat’s analysis and recommendation, is typically provided to ministers one week in advance of a Treasury Board meeting. 
A certain number of items are identified, or “flagged” in advance, because of their scope or profile, and are formally presented to Ministers at the meeting by senior officials from the Secretariat
The other items are proposed for approval without discussion; however, during the meeting ministers can ask questions on any item on the agenda.
Decisions from Treasury Board are then communicated to departments so they can start implementation or address the Board’s concerns.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Be Storm Ready When You Travel</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jfOlFDtfPM</link><author>Global Affairs Canada</author><category>youtube</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/4jfOlFDtfPM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 15:14:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIVMBvs03h74NSdQMH31jKA">Global Affairs Canada</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🌴☀️ Travelling to a sunny destination?

The study – Cleared for take-off: Elevating airline competition—highlights the barriers that make it hard for new and smaller airlines to enter, grow and compete. It also examines how the lack of competition in the industry impacts Canadians, especially those in northern and remote communities where air transportation may be the only available option for essential services.

The H2O Conference is back—Canada’s biggest ocean tech event and a global hub for marine innovation. Powered by ACOA and hosted by the Ocean Technology Council of Nova Scotia, it all wraps June 12 with Cove Demo Day!
#MarineTech #OceanInnovation

Transcript
So H2O is a platform that we use to showcase our ocean technology sector.
It’s a way for our companies to come together and showcase their technologies and innovations and work with partners from around the world.

The conference has really grown and scaled over the last ten years.

It started out really as an industry showcase specifically for companies here in Nova Scotia.

But we've really grown it into an international conference with companies from all across Canada and around the world. 

Having our international partners here is very important for the H2O conference and for our ocean technology sector as a whole.

We really have worked to turn H2O into an anchor event  that's on the calendar of international partners and members of the ocean tech sector
around the world.

So for us the ocean technology sector is predominantly driven by export.

So about 80% of our company's revenues come from export.

And with that we need to have partnerships; connections with our international markets.

And the H2O conference is a way to kind of bring those partners in 
and showcase what we do best here in Atlantic Canada.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cruise Canada and New England Symposium, 2025 - Halifax, Nova Scotia</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz0uHkIgFDk</link><author>ACOACanada</author><category>youtube</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Lz0uHkIgFDk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 9 Jun 2025 18:28:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFRoY5IvADtfCf1folzzc-A">ACOACanada</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cruise tourism is making a big impact in Atlantic Canada.

Libra is a non-alcoholic craft beer company committed to helping its customers find their balance.
While working in the beverage industry, Mitch Cobb and Mike Hogan found themselves constantly sampling products and socializing. A non-alcoholic beer seemed like the answer.
The brewers couldn't find a non-alcoholic craft beer that tasted like the real thing - so they made their own. 
After 2 years of research and development, Libra Non Alcoholic Craft Beer was launched in 2020. Libra is brewed just like a regular craft beer, with none of the alcohol and fewer calories.
Leveraging the assets and relationships of Libra’s sister company Upstreet, the brew-master has created an agile product development pipeline.
The non-alcoholic beer category is expected to grow at a rate of 7.8% over 10 years to $43.6B,  according to Future Market Insights.
Libra is recognized as a leading brand by international media and the craft beer community.
The brewery has won several international beer awards, including "Canadian Non-Alcoholic Brewery of the Year" at the New York International Beer Competition.
Since 2020, Libra has secured distribution in 1,000 retail locations and restaurants across Canada including Sobeys, Loblaws, IGA, and Costco.
As retailers continue to see an increase in demand for non-alcoholic beer, Libra is focused on becoming the category leader in North America.
The company is educating retailers and consumers on the benefits of incorporating non-alcoholic beverages to live a healthier lifestyle.
In 2021, Canadian folk artist Serena Ryder was appointed Libra’s Chief Balance Ambassador. Together, they went on a mission to normalize socializing without alcohol.
“Libra completely aligns with my core values ... it’s everything that I believe in, and I really love the beer.” - Serena Ryder
Libra is proudly B Corp Certified, a global community of companies verified to meet high social and environmental standards.
B Corps around the world are working together to redefine success in business and build a more inclusive and sustainable economy.
ACOA is proud to support Libra as they create positive change and set the standard for the non-alcoholic beverage market.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Health Impacts of Physically Demanding Work</title><link>https://ccohs.libsyn.com/the-health-impacts-of-physically-demanding-work</link><author></author><enclosure url="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/ccohs/Avi_Biswas_normalized_1.mp3?dest-id=32116" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://ccohs.libsyn.com/">CCOHS Podcasts</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Do physically active occupations make for healthier workers?

The episode features insights on AI, productivity, and Canada’s “12/21 problem,” where outdated learning models fall short in a 21st-century workforce. Key discussions focus on the need for risk-taking in business, the importance of social and emotional skills, and the critical role of trust in the workplace. Strachan also explores immigration’s role in Canada’s future, barriers faced by international students, and the impact of the Future Skills Centre’s efforts to foster an inclusive economy through innovative partnerships and initiatives across Canada. On October 23 and 24, 2024, Magnet Network hosted a two-day networking and knowledge-sharing event in Toronto’s distillery district. Featuring an array of speakers who are thought leaders, policymakers, and visionary idea accelerators in the skills ecosystem in Canada, Magnet Network Live (MNL) was a key forum for stakeholders to meet and hear insights on the pressing issues related to training, workforce development, and productivity in Canada. Conference Board of Canada was there in two capacities. Michael Burt, VP, was featured in a session alongside Candice Faktor, CEO of Disco, in a “fireside chat to explore why businesses are holding back on critical investments and how innovative learning models can shift this dynamic.” Jeremy Strachan, SRA, attended to record live audio as content for this episode. Content interviews and ambient and atmospheric textures of the event.Canada’s productivity puzzle remains unsolved, and a combination of skills waste, talent mismatch, and forecast labour shortages in key sectors like the skilled trades and the green economy are set to exacerbate our problems.

So, we've had this dream for many, many years. But of course, it takes funding to do these types of things. 
And as a small community, we don't always have the resources to make these things happen. 
So obviously when we approached ACOA with the idea and the relevance as well as the opportunities and the benefits for our community ACOA came forward obviously with funding.
The importance of the amphitheater as well as the connecting trail to our residents is something that they've been asking for for many, many years.
As Canada's most active community in 2023, we show that having a very connected community is important where people can walk trails and do recreational activities.
The amphitheater was one of those where we could bring people together in our community, connecting place where we can grow as one.

The strategies used by bad actors are getting more and more complex. Many of us are inundated with what feels like never-ending phishing emails, scam text messages and fraudulent phone calls. It’s rare to talk to someone who hasn’t experienced some form of a cyber attack. The situation is no different for Canadian businesses. Identity theft, scams, fraud, and ransomware are only some of the ways cyber attackers are targeting businesses today. One cyber security breach can cost a business thousands of dollars and valuable time resources to neutralize. We wanted to know: Is cyber crime on the rise in Canada? What is the relatively new phenomenon of cyber risk insurance? And in what way are consumers affected when a business experiences a security breach? The Canadian Survey of Cyber Security and Cyber Crime has published new data and, in this episode, we sat down with Howard Bilodeau, an economist at Statistics Canada to answer our questions about how cyber security is changing for businesses and what it means for the rest of us.  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Prevent Slips, Trips and Falls with Good Workplace Housekeeping</title><link>https://ccohs.libsyn.com/prevent-slips-trips-and-falls-with-good-workplace-housekeeping</link><author></author><enclosure url="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/ccohs/Episode217_SlipsTripsFalls_English.mp3?dest-id=32116" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2024 17:38:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://ccohs.libsyn.com/">CCOHS Podcasts</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Good workplace housekeeping might seem like a simple concept, but it doesn't always get the respect it deserves.
