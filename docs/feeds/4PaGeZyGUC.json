Do particles ever collide or do they just get really really close? Did anything go ‚Äúbang‚Äù during the Big Bang? Neil deGrasse Tyson, co-host Paul Mecurio, and astrophysicist Charles Liu tackle these cosmic questions and more!\n\nShouldn‚Äôt the vacuum of space cause interstellar gas clouds to disperse evenly? We break down how diffusion works and how different forces come together to keep gas clouds intact. What‚Äôs in these clouds, and why does some gas get left behind during star formation? Next, we confront the Big Bang itself: what exactly went ‚Äúbang‚Äù? We dive into the misconceptions surrounding the term and its origins with Fred Hoyle. \n\nWhat can we learn from gravitational waves beyond just detecting them? We explore the structure of spacetime and the speed of gravity. How do gravitational waves offer a deeper understanding of the universe‚Äôs invisible framework? Could slowing down time increase mass? We discuss the manipulation of time and the nature of scientific inquiry. \n\nAs the discussion turns to cosmic collisions, we explore how galaxies interact without stars ever touching. Do particles ever collide or do they just get really really close? What forces govern these interactions, and how do fields and forces influence the behavior of matter? Charles reveals the almost magical dynamics of gravitational and electromagnetic forces, while Neil ties it back to Newton and Einstein.\n\nFinally, we look back in time to the earliest generations of stars. How do we study stars that existed billions of years ago, and what did these stellar giants sacrifice to forge the elements of life? Charles delivers a heartfelt tribute to these cosmic ancestors, reminding us how the light of the past illuminates our understanding of the universe today.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Charles Liu\n02:15 - Why Don‚Äôt Gas Clouds Disperse? \n10:01 - What Went ‚ÄúBang‚Äù?\n22:56 - What Will We Learn From Gravitational Waves? \n31:15 - Do Particles Ever Touch? \n39:55 - Observing Early Generation Stars\n46:28 - Could Slowing Time Make You More Massive? \n49:57 - Closing\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Did the Catholic Church help them? A research team spent months investigating.\n\nAfter two teenagers accused Catholic priest Dieter Scholz of abuse in 1963, he disappeared overseas. He went to work in Bolivia as a missionary with the approval of his archdiocese. After his return to Germany, he went on to abuse many others. Even though church authorities were aware of the accusations against him, he was allowed to continue in his post. Priest Josef Zottmann was also able to vanish abroad. In his case, he was trying to escape a warrant for his arrest. Five school girls had reported him to the police for sexual abuse in 1969. The diocese of Eichst√§tt continued to finance Zottmann abroad by concealing it as a \"mission donation.‚Äù High-ranking church officials in Germany and Brazil were informed about the police investigation, but they did not cooperate with the authorities. Zottmann returned to Germany in the 1980s after the crimes reached their statute of limitations.\n\nLawyer Bettina Janssen has also come across other cases that match this profile. The Catholic Church, including the German Bishops‚Äô Conference, has commissioned her to look through their files. She concluded that: \"People found diverse ways of keeping priests under cover and concealing their ties to a diocese, of sweeping incidents under the rug, and of providing financial support.‚Äù Janssen regards such practices as \"a form of obstruction of justice‚Äù. No consideration at all was given to the victims. \n\nSo did the Catholic Church consciously hide perpetrators of abuse abroad? A documentary team went looking for answers in Germany and South America.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #catholic #church #germany #southamerica \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The real boom, however, came with the discovery of electricity, which eventually led to the global grid of artificial lighting we have today. \n\nBut most of life on Earth has evolved to rely only on the light of the moon and the stars at night. Anything brighter than that creates an imbalance that can have deadly consequences. And this isn‚Äôt only true for nocturnal creatures.

The conversation ties in psychological safety, a key factor in high-performing teams, as outlined by Amy C.

Dead and sick birds began showing up on shorelines. Poultry farms were forced to cull millions of animals, often in horrific ways, to help stop the spread. Egg prices skyrocketed. Farmers lost millions of dollars. The problem doesn‚Äôt stop with birds; avian flu has also been found in a wide range of mammals. More than 24,000 sea lions in South America have reportedly died from it. Then, on January 6, 2025, the US reported the first human death. It‚Äôs an alarming development, but fortunately an outlier. The truth is avian flu still poses little threat to humans. But if we‚Äôre not worried now, when should we be? \n\n\nSupport our work.

Why is this happening?\n\nIn the Netherlands researchers say it was 18-34 year olds who helped the right-wing populist Geert Wilders to victory in the parliamentary elections. In Italy too, the Brothers of Italy, a party that is considered post-fascist, is in power. In Germany, there will be an early federal election at the end of February. According to surveys, the AfD, parts of which have been classified as right-wing extremist, has a good chance of significantly increasing its share of the vote. The renowned youth researcher Prof. Klaus Hurrelmann says that the success of such parties is also due to their aggressive advertising towards young voters in the digital sphere. In their report, Alexandra von Nahmen and Finlay Duncan examine the question of what else makes radical parties so attractive to young people that they end up voting for them.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:49 Rome ‚Äì Why are young people fans of fascism?\n02:50 Rome ‚Äì At the HQ of Forza Nouva\n04:00 An expert‚Äôs take - Prof Hurrelmann\n04:42 Netherlands ‚Äì A dinner party with right-populists\n07:00 Netherlands ‚Äì How right-wing populists use social media\n08:41 Germany ‚Äì Protests against Alternative of Germany\n09:20 Germany ‚Äì Inside an AfD rally\n10:47 Simple answers to complex issues?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #reporter #politics #elections #europe \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

We explore how magicians, like scientists, seek to understand the limits of human cognition. From change blindness to attentional blindness, we discuss how magic tricks exploit cognitive gaps. How does humor help magicians distract an audience? What can neuroscience learn from the study of stage magic?\n\nWe also examine the ethical questions surrounding magic and deception. Should magicians expose fraudulent psychics who exploit belief? Can illusions help teach critical thinking? Plus, learn where the rabbit coming out of the top hat came from and other magic lore. \n\nThanks to our Patrons Jon Alvarez, Peter Dyreng, Joseph Dolan, Chesterfield Browne, Vinkey, Raymot Holmes, Kev, Kamila Kaftol, Biko Duncan, Nathan Hill, Alex Mertz, Erik Berglund Photography, Tricia Lynch, Mathaniel Spomer, Micheal Palmer, John Keltonic, Jack Williams, Eric Christensen, Melissa Palladino, Chris Ormonde, Tom Somers, Ivynelsewhere, Rafael Arenas Jr, Maurice Bakker, Flamigo Toes, Cadu Magarinos Torres, Tanner Simon, and Mike Nagavalli for supporting us this week.\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

The most populous city in Israel is a holy place for Christians, Jews and Muslims. And claims to its historic sites are the subject of furious dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThe documentary sheds light on the political and religious background to the conflict over Jerusalem and places the current events in their historical context. Those involved have their say and experts comment on the current situation. Hamas named its 7 October terrorist attack on Israel ‚ÄòOperation Al-Aqsa Flood‚Äô in reference to the famous Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.\nIn doing so, the Islamists are once again focusing global attention on the Holy City. Both sides lay claim to the Temple Mount, a place of religious significance for both communities. This is why Jerusalem has always been at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation. Middle East experts agree on one point: without a solution for Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim as the capital of their state, or possible future state, this conflict will not be resolved.\nThe documentary, which was made after 7 October, investigates one of the most profound conflicts of our time. It explores invisible borders, sheds light on the failed UN partition plan and tells of the eternal battle for the holy sites on Temple Mount. The film depicts a city where people co-exist without hatred, where a modern ‚Äòstart-up nation‚Äô rubs shoulders with ancient culture - and where hope has not yet been completely extinguished. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #jerusalem \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A heroine, forgotten by history, who fearlessly saved Jewish lives. The name of her husband Oskar Schindler became synonymous with acts of compassion and humanity in the Nazi era. But what role did his wife Emilie Schindler play?\n\nFilmmaker Annette Baumeister tells the story of Emilie Schindler, who protected people without attracting much attention. After the war, Emilie was abandoned by her husband and forgotten by the world. \n\nEmilie Pelzl was born in the Sudetenland in 1907. From an early age, she worked on her parents' farm and cared for relatives. At the age of 20, she fell in love with the charming Oskar Schindler. Although he was considered a heartbreaker, she married him. Oskar had affairs and squandered the dowry, but Emilie stuck by him. During World War Two, the Schindlers ran factories and employed Jewish workers - saving many of them from the death camps.\n\nIn this documentary, Emilie Schindler's Argentinian carer Leandro Coseforti, her niece Traude Ferrari, and historians all describe a forgotten heroine. Annette Baumeister sensitively reconstructs Emilie Schindler's life, bringing her out of her husband's shadow. \n\nThe film draws a picture of a woman who risked her life to help others. By procuring food and medicine for those in need, she helped to rescue many Jewish people right under the noses of the SS.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #holocaustsurvivor #germany \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
