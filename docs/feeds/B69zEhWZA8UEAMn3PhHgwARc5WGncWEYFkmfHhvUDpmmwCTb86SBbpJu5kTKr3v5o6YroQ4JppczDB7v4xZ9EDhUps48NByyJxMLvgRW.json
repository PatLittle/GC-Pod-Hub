They don’t appear on sales receipts.  \n\nWhy do countries use tariffs? \nTo raise revenue for public services and/ or to protect domestic production by making foreign goods more expensive. \n\nHow do tariffs affect me?  \nTariffs can impact the prices you pay at the store. When the cost of importing goods increases, businesses pass the bulk of this cost onto consumers.  \n\nWhy do Canada’s free trade agreements matter?  \nCanada’s 15 free trade agreements provide Canadians with tariff-free access to nearly all products traded between Canada and its free-trade partners. This helps Canadian businesses access markets in over 50 countries representing 1.5 billion consumers and keeps us connected to the world. \n\nFor more information: https://www.canada.ca/unitedstatestariffs</article>","contentLength":858,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/-IW_ODQ6Qeg?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"G7 2025 Short Logo Reveal","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUjkNzkL_FI","date":1736863991,"author":"Global Affairs Canada","guid":51,"unread":true,"content":"<article>G7 2025 Kananaskis Short Logo Reveal\nShowing scenic shots of a mountain in the Kananaskis area with a river and forest in the foreground, overlaid at the end with the G7 2025 Kananaskis logo featuring a grey stylized image of a mountain and a green pine tree with seven branches.
