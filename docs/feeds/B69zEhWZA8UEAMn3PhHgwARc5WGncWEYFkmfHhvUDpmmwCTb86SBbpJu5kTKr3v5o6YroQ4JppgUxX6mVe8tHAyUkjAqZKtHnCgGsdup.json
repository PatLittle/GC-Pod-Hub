It provides advice and recommendations.\nThe Treasury Board has two distinct functions known as Part A and Part B.\nFor Part A\nMinisters will consider proposals—Treasury Board submissions—from sponsoring ministers. \nThese submissions seek access to funding and/or authorities, such as the ability to enter into contracts or undertake projects, to advance the government’s agenda. \nTreasury Board also approves the ruleset governing financial and project management, contracting, and people and IT management in the government. \nAs the employer, Treasury Board will also be asked to approve collective agreements for the federal public service. \nTreasury Board considers about 350 proposals per year.\nFor Part B: \nThe Treasury Board also serves as the Governor in Council. It considers regulations and orders-in-council that are meant to protect the health, safety, or security of Canadians and the environment, and support a competitive and innovative economy.\nAnnually, the Treasury Board considers 100 to 200 regulatory proposals. \nIt also considers 200 to 300 non-regulatory orders-in-council including those that authorize Canada to enter into international agreements, or bring legislation into force. \nRegulations and orders-in-council are typically made public after approval.\nThe Treasury Board usually meets once a week when Parliament is sitting, or more frequently when there are many submissions to consider. Each meeting includes a Part A and a Part B agenda and typically lasts two to three hours.  \nEach Treasury Board submission, along with the Treasury Board Secretariat’s analysis and recommendation, is typically provided to ministers one week in advance of a Treasury Board meeting. \nA certain number of items are identified, or “flagged” in advance, because of their scope or profile, and are formally presented to Ministers at the meeting by senior officials from the Secretariat\nThe other items are proposed for approval without discussion; however, during the meeting ministers can ask questions on any item on the agenda.\nDecisions from Treasury Board are then communicated to departments so they can start implementation or address the Board’s concerns.</article>","contentLength":2691,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/50r3Yuqeats?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Security Awareness (COR310)","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2I0idihsAQ","date":1738945452,"author":"TBS Canada","guid":35,"unread":true,"content":"<article>To take the training: https://catalogue.csps-efpc.gc.ca/product?catalog=COR310&amp;cm_locale=en \nGeneral public access to the training: https://opn.csps-efpc.gc.ca/viewer/COR310-EN\n\nThis video was produced by the Communications team at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.\n\nThis video is also available in French: https://youtu.be/5ZfM9VskZMY</article>","contentLength":343,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/Z2I0idihsAQ?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"GC Digital Talent Platform Instructional Video","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8bWujSZio","date":1731703418,"author":"TBS Canada","guid":34,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The GC Digital Talent platform instructional video helps individuals create a profile and navigate through the process to apply for digital talent opportunities in the Government of Canada. \n\nThis video is also available in French: https://youtu.be/SD794Uv8K6A</article>","contentLength":260,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/8u8bWujSZio?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["youtube"]}
